Very O 0
Disappointing O 0

– O 0
I O 0
took O 0
my O 0
parents O 0
here O 0
for O 0
their O 0
anniversary-very O 0
very O 0
disappointed O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

I O 0
liked B-OP 1
the O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
very O 0
much O 0
but O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
not O 0
worth O 0
the O 0
price O 0
. O 0

I O 0
may O 0
not O 0
be O 0
a O 0
sushi O 0
guru O 0
but O 0
I O 0
can O 0
tell O 0
you O 0
that O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
here O 0
is O 0
just O 0
okay B-OP 1
and O 0
that O 0
there O 0
is O 0
not O 0
much O 0
else O 0
to O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Rice B-T 2
is O 0
too B-OP 1
dry I-OP 1
, O 0
tuna B-T 2
was O 0
n't O 0
so O 0
fresh O 0
either O 0
. O 0

Nothing O 0
really O 0
came O 0
across O 0
as O 0
outstanding O 0
. O 0

Very O 0
disappointed O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
eaten O 0
here O 0
three O 0
times O 0
and O 0
have O 0
found O 0
the O 0
quality O 0
and O 0
variety O 0
of O 0
the O 0
fish B-T 2
to O 0
be O 0
excellent B-OP 1
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
the O 0
value O 0
and O 0
service B-T 2
are O 0
both O 0
severely O 0
lacking B-OP 1
. O 0

Portions O 0
contain O 0
less O 0
fish O 0
than O 0
one O 0
would O 0
expect O 0
, O 0
particularly O 0
since O 0
prices O 0
are O 0
in O 0
line O 0
with O 0
the O 0
best O 0
sushi O 0
places O 0
in O 0
NYC O 0
( O 0
Masa O 0
excluded O 0
, O 0
of O 0
course O 0
) O 0
. O 0

Furthermore O 0
, O 0
while O 0
the O 0
fish B-T 2
is O 0
unquestionably O 0
fresh B-OP 1
, O 0
rolls B-T 2
tend O 0
to O 0
be O 0
inexplicably O 0
bland O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
ranges O 0
from O 0
mediocre B-OP 1
to O 0
offensive B-OP 1
. O 0

On O 0
a O 0
recent O 0
trip O 0
, O 0
our O 0
waiter B-T 2
was O 0
extremely O 0
dismissive B-OP 1
, O 0
while O 0
no O 0
less O 0
than O 0
three O 0
staff B-T 2
members I-T 2
waited O 0
hand-and-foot O 0
on O 0
a O 0
pair O 0
of O 0
Japanese O 0
girls O 0
seated O 0
nearby O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
then O 0
charged O 0
for O 0
their O 0
most O 0
expensive O 0
sake O 0
( O 0
$ O 0
20+ O 0
per O 0
serving O 0
) O 0
when O 0
we O 0
in O 0
fact O 0
drank O 0
a O 0
sake O 0
of O 0
less O 0
than O 0
half O 0
that O 0
price O 0
. O 0

But O 0
Im O 0
sure O 0
this O 0
was O 0
just O 0
an O 0
honest O 0
mistake O 0
. O 0
. O 0

way O 0
this O 0
place B-T 2
survives O 0
with O 0
such O 0
average B-OP 1
food B-T 2

I O 0
believe O 0

The O 0
only O 0
drawback O 0
is O 0
the O 0
crowded B-OP 1

and O 0
the O 0
slow O 0

– O 0
My O 0
first O 0
time O 0
to O 0
dine O 0
at O 0
this O 0
restaurant B-T 2
was O 0
with O 0
my O 0
son O 0
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
absolutely O 0
horrible O 0
! O 0

We O 0
waited O 0
over O 0
30 O 0
minutes O 0
for O 0
our O 0
drinks O 0
and O 0
over O 0
1 O 0
1/2 O 0
hours O 0
for O 0
our O 0
food O 0
. O 0

I O 0
swore O 0
never O 0
to O 0
return O 0
for O 0
a O 0
warm B-OP 1

and O 0
mediocre O 0
meal B-T 2

HOWEVER O 0
, O 0
one O 0
Sunday O 0
afternoon O 0
my O 0
husband O 0
and O 0
I O 0
did O 0
go O 0
( O 0
although O 0
with O 0
my O 0
loud O 0
protests O 0
) O 0
and O 0
were O 0
pleasantly O 0
surprised O 0
. O 0

The O 0
band B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
attentive O 0
. O 0

Outside O 0
in O 0
the O 0
area O 0
between O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
and O 0
the O 0
park O 0
, O 0
children O 0
were O 0
running O 0
around O 0
while O 0
their O 0
parents O 0
sipped O 0

. O 0

We O 0
ordered O 0
a O 0

all O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1

It O 0
was O 0
like O 0
dining O 0
at O 0
a O 0
completely O 0
different O 0
restaurant O 0
. O 0

We O 0
have O 0
since O 0
returned O 0
and O 0
also O 0
had O 0
a O 0
great O 0
experience O 0
, O 0
sampling O 0
more O 0
small O 0

the O 0

( O 0
cold O 0
and O 0
good O 0
) O 0

We O 0
did O 0
have O 0
the O 0
same O 0
waiter B-T 2
the O 0
second O 0
time O 0
, O 0
so O 0
maybe O 0
the O 0
service O 0
is O 0
spotty O 0
and O 0
our O 0
luck O 0
is O 0
good O 0
. O 0

Sunday O 0
afternoons O 0
there O 0
is O 0
a O 0

playing O 0
and O 0

is O 0

, O 0
so O 0
there O 0
was O 0
no O 0
wait O 0
for O 0
a O 0

. O 0

The O 0
sushi B-T 2

was O 0
quick O 0
. O 0

The O 0

right O 0
too O 0
. O 0

The O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
was O 0
just O 0
okay B-OP 1
. O 0

Space B-T 2
was O 0
limited B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0

made O 0
up O 0
for O 0
it O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'd O 0
go O 0
back O 0

The O 0

posted O 0
`` O 0

'' O 0

Well O 0
I O 0
guess O 0
it O 0
's O 0
hard O 0
to O 0
be O 0
seated O 0
when O 0
one O 0

We O 0
stood O 0

walked O 0
back O 0
and O 0

ignoring B-OP 1

past O 0
weekend O 0

great O 0
weather O 0
for O 0
San O 0

standards O 0
. O 0

So O 0
for O 0
the O 0
'after O 0
beach O 0
excursion O 0
' O 0
, O 0
we O 0
thought O 0
we O 0
would O 0
end O 0
the O 0
day O 0
on O 0
a O 0
high O 0
note O 0
and O 0
make O 0
the O 0

across O 0

from O 0
the O 0
beach O 0
to O 0
Park O 0

The O 0
restaurant O 0
was O 0
busy O 0
, O 0
however O 0
there O 0
were O 0
a O 0
few O 0
tables O 0
open O 0
. O 0

We O 0
put O 0
out O 0
name O 0
down O 0
and O 0
although O 0
there O 0
were O 0
open O 0
tables O 0
we O 0
were O 0
told O 0
that O 0
it O 0
'd O 0
be O 0
a O 0
30 O 0
minute O 0
wait O 0
. O 0

So O 0
here O 0
we O 0
are O 0
, O 0
my O 0
wife O 0
, O 0
3 O 0
year O 0
old O 0
daughter O 0
and O 0
I O 0
trying O 0
to O 0
pass O 0
the O 0
time O 0
by O 0
hanging O 0
out O 0
in O 0
the O 0
front O 0
of O 0
the O 0
building O 0
( O 0
where O 0
the O 0
murals O 0
and O 0
artifacts O 0
are O 0
) O 0
. O 0

30 O 0
minutes O 0
went O 0
by O 0
and O 0
sure O 0
enough O 0
the O 0
pager O 0
buzzer O 0
went O 0
off O 0
. O 0

We O 0
went O 0
back O 0
to O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
and O 0
low O 0
and O 0
behold O 0
, O 0
we O 0
were O 0
seated O 0
at O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
tables O 0
that O 0
was O 0
available O 0
30 O 0
minutes O 0

! O 0
! O 0

Logic O 0
behind O 0
that O 0
? O 0

None O 0
that O 0
I O 0
can O 0
think O 0
of O 0
. O 0

We O 0
put O 0
in O 0
our O 0
order O 0
and O 0
although O 0
we O 0
ordered O 0
4 O 0
appetizers O 0
, O 0
the O 0

did O 0
n't O 0
arrive O 0

now O 0
what O 0
are O 0
appetizers O 0
for O 0
? O 0
? O 0
? O 0

Oh O 0
I O 0
forgot O 0

( O 0
she O 0
had O 0
a O 0
sore O 0

) O 0
and O 0
I O 0
guess O 0
that O 0
since O 0
it O 0
was O 0
only O 0

, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
n't O 0
a O 0

Food B-T 2
wise O 0
, O 0
its O 0
ok B-OP 1
but O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
pricey B-OP 1
for O 0
what O 0
you O 0
get O 0
considering O 0
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
is O 0
n't O 0
a O 0

its O 0
very O 0
poor B-OP 1
customer B-T 2
service I-T 2
. O 0

While O 0
this O 0
diner O 0
had O 0
reasonably O 0
good B-OP 1
food B-T 2
, O 0
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
staff I-T 2
seemed O 0
completely O 0
indifferent O 0
to O 0
our O 0
presence O 0
, O 0
and O 0
this O 0
attitude O 0
was O 0
reflected O 0
in O 0
the O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
service O 0
. O 0

As O 0
part O 0
of O 0
a O 0
small O 0
party O 0
of O 0
four O 0
, O 0
our O 0
food O 0
was O 0
dropped O 0
off O 0
without O 0
comment O 0
; O 0

any O 0
further O 0
needs O 0
we O 0
may O 0
have O 0

been O 0
met O 0
since O 0
no O 0
one O 0
stopped O 0
by O 0
the O 0
table O 0
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0
finally O 0
were O 0
able O 0
to O 0
flag O 0
someone O 0
down O 0
, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
someone O 0
entirely O 0
different O 0
from O 0
the O 0
person O 0
who O 0
had O 0
dropped O 0
off O 0
the O 0
food O 0
, O 0
who O 0
was O 0
also O 0
not O 0
the O 0
same O 0
person O 0
who O 0
had O 0
taken O 0
our O 0
order O 0
. O 0

After O 0
one O 0
member O 0
of O 0
our O 0
party O 0
had O 0
been O 0
bumped O 0
repeatedly O 0
by O 0
a O 0
waitress B-T 2
, O 0
a O 0
polite O 0
request O 0
that O 0
he O 0
not O 0
be O 0
bumped O 0
sent O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
into O 0
an O 0
abusive O 0
rant O 0
. O 0

A O 0
brief O 0
conversation O 0
with O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
at O 0
the O 0
end O 0
of O 0
the O 0
meal O 0
was O 0
the O 0
greatest O 0
disappointment O 0
-- O 0
to O 0
say O 0
we O 0
had O 0
been O 0
`` O 0
blown O 0
off O 0
'' O 0
would O 0
be O 0
an O 0
understatement O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
continually O 0
interrupted O 0
with O 0
`` O 0
Is O 0
there O 0
anything O 0
else O 0
I O 0
can O 0
do O 0
for O 0
you O 0
? O 0
'' O 0
, O 0
a O 0
strange O 0
comment O 0
because O 0
she O 0
had O 0
hardly O 0
listened O 0
, O 0
let O 0
alone O 0
responded O 0
to O 0
our O 0
expression O 0
of O 0
disappointment O 0
at O 0
our O 0
experience O 0

She O 0
promised O 0
to O 0
speak O 0
to O 0
the O 0
waitress O 0
who O 0
had O 0
flown O 0
off O 0
in O 0
a O 0
rage O 0
, O 0
but O 0
we O 0
could O 0
hardly O 0
take O 0
her O 0
promise O 0
seriously O 0
, O 0
seeing O 0
as O 0
she O 0
had O 0
n't O 0
bothered O 0
to O 0
get O 0
the O 0
waitresses O 0
name O 0

In O 0
short O 0

of O 0
their O 0

When O 0
I O 0

was O 0

by O 0
their O 0
incredible B-OP 1

midway O 0
through O 0

We O 0
were O 0
quickly O 0
seated O 0
and O 0

the O 0

I O 0
got O 0
the O 0
shellfish B-T 2
and I-T 2
shrimp I-T 2
appetizer I-T 2
and I-T 2
it O 0
was O 0
alright B-OP 1

It O 0
was B-OP 1
n't I-OP 1
the I-OP 1
freshest I-OP 1
seafood B-T 2
ever O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the B-OP 1
taste O 0
and O 0
presentation O 0
was B-OP 1
OK I-OP 1
. O 0

Before O 0
the O 0
steak O 0
came O 0
, O 0
the O 0
server O 0
told O 0
us O 0
that O 0
the O 0
steak O 0
did O 0
not O 0
come O 0
with O 0
any O 0
sides O 0
and O 0
suggested O 0
I O 0
pick O 0
something O 0
from O 0
the O 0
menu O 0
. O 0

I O 0
picked O 0
the O 0
asparagus B-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
turned O 0
out O 0
to O 0
be O 0
incredible B-OP 1
and O 0
perfectly B-OP 1
prepared I-OP 1
. O 0

It O 0
was O 0
steamed O 0
and O 0
tossed O 0
with O 0
garlic O 0
. O 0

The O 0
9 B-T 2
oz I-T 2
steak I-T 2
came O 0
next O 0
and O 0
it O 0
tasted O 0
great O 0
, O 0
at O 0
least O 0
initially O 0
. O 0

The O 0
steak B-T 2
was O 0
done O 0
to O 0
my O 0
exact O 0
liking O 0
( O 0
medium O 0
rare O 0
) O 0
and O 0
was O 0
nice B-OP 1
and O 0
juicy B-OP 1
. O 0

It O 0
? O 0
s O 0
served O 0
with O 0
either O 0
a O 0
peppercorn B-T 2
sauce I-T 2
or O 0
red B-T 2
wine I-T 2
reduction I-T 2
, O 0
though O 0
both O 0
were O 0
indistinguishable B-OP 1
in O 0
taste O 0
. O 0

Though O 0
, O 0
one O 0
thing O 0
I O 0
realized O 0
later O 0
on O 0
was O 0
that O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
either O 0
used O 0
MSG O 0
or O 0
a O 0
meat O 0
tenderizer O 0
on O 0
the O 0
steak B-T 2
. O 0

My O 0
mouth O 0
felt O 0
very O 0
dry O 0
afterwards O 0
and O 0
I O 0
had O 0
that O 0
signature O 0
? O 0
MSG O 0
? O 0
taste O 0
lingering O 0
in O 0
my O 0
throat O 0
after O 0
I O 0
left O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
. O 0

Finally O 0
, O 0
the O 0
homemade O 0
donut O 0
holes O 0
were O 0
served O 0
for O 0
desert O 0
. O 0

They O 0
came O 0
in O 0
their O 0
own O 0
nifty O 0
take O 0
out O 0
box O 0
and O 0
with O 0
some O 0
homemade O 0
frosting O 0
; O 0
very O 0
light O 0
and O 0
not-too-sweet O 0
. O 0

The O 0
desert B-T 2
was O 0
the O 0
perfect B-OP 1
ending O 0
to O 0
an O 0
almost O 0
perfect B-OP 1
dinner B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
dinner O 0
only O 0
took O 0
us O 0
about O 0
an O 0
hour O 0
and O 0
the O 0
prices O 0
were O 0
alright O 0
for O 0
the O 0
strip O 0
, O 0
almost O 0
$ O 0
50/pp O 0
after O 0
tax O 0
and O 0
tip O 0
( O 0
about O 0
average O 0
) O 0
. O 0

But O 0
the O 0
servers B-T 2
were O 0
extremely O 0
attentive B-OP 1
and O 0
very O 0
friendly B-OP 1

This O 0

enough O 0
for O 0
it O 0
to O 0
be O 0

Snooze O 0

a O 0

The O 0
presentation O 0
of O 0
Snooze B-T 2
is O 0
excellent B-OP 1
and O 0
it O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
those O 0
places O 0
that O 0
you O 0
feel O 0
more O 0
sophisticated O 0
just O 0
for O 0
being O 0
there O 0
; O 0
but O 0
peel O 0
back O 0
the O 0
layers O 0
and O 0
you O 0
have O 0
an O 0
overpriced O 0

off O 0

I O 0
should O 0

just O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
the O 0
check O 0
when O 0
I O 0
saw O 0
that O 0

their O 0
menu B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
unique B-OP 1

the O 0

sample O 0
of O 0
3 O 0
different O 0

is O 0
well O 0
over-priced O 0

The O 0
pancakes B-T 2
should O 0
be O 0
larger O 0
( O 0
at O 0

8 O 0

to O 0
justify O 0
the O 0
expense O 0
even O 0
with O 0
the O 0
unique O 0

The O 0
flavors O 0
were O 0
good O 0

I O 0
have O 0
had O 0

better O 0

that O 0
were O 0

significantly O 0
larger O 0

On O 0
my O 0
meal B-T 2
I O 0
had O 0
to O 0
send O 0
back O 0
my O 0

request O 0
of O 0

in O 0
the O 0

Ray O 0

something O 0
of O 0

given O 0
its O 0
gorgeous B-OP 1
Sound B-T 2
views I-T 2
, O 0
I O 0
had O 0
suspected O 0
that O 0
the O 0
accolades O 0
were O 0
more O 0
due O 0
to O 0
the O 0
scenery O 0
than O 0
to O 0

Imagine O 0

I O 0
did O 0
remain O 0
puzzled O 0
by O 0
one O 0
issue O 0
: O 0
Who O 0
thinks O 0
that O 0

the O 0
idea O 0
. O 0
. O 0

All O 0
considered O 0

I O 0
have O 0
to O 0
say O 0
that O 0
Ray B-T 2

deserving O 0
of O 0
its O 0
title O 0
as O 0

While O 0
I O 0
