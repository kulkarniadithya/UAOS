But O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
horrible B-OP 1
to O 0
us O 0
. O 0

To O 0
be O 0
completely O 0
fair O 0
, O 0
the O 0
only O 0
redeeming O 0
factor O 0
was O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
above B-OP 1
average I-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
could O 0
n't O 0
make O 0
up O 0
for O 0
all O 0
the O 0
other O 0
deficiencies O 0
of O 0
Teodora O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
uniformly O 0
exceptional B-OP 1
, O 0
with O 0
a O 0
very O 0
capable O 0
kitchen B-T 2
which O 0
will O 0
proudly O 0
whip O 0
up O 0
whatever O 0
you O 0
feel O 0
like O 0
eating O 0
, O 0
whether O 0
it O 0
's O 0
on O 0
the O 0
menu B-T 2
or O 0
not O 0
. O 0

Where O 0
Gabriela O 0
personaly O 0
greets O 0
you O 0
and O 0
recommends O 0
you O 0
what O 0
to O 0
eat O 0
. O 0

For O 0
those O 0
that O 0
go O 0
once O 0
and O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
enjoy O 0
it O 0
, O 0
all O 0
I O 0
can O 0
say O 0
is O 0
that O 0
they O 0
just O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
get O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Not O 0
only O 0
was O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
outstanding O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
little O 0
'perks O 0
' O 0
were O 0
great O 0
. O 0

It O 0
is O 0
very O 0
overpriced O 0
and O 0
not O 0
very O 0
tasty O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
agreed O 0
favorite B-OP 1
is O 0
the O 0
orrechiete B-T 2
with I-T 2
sausage I-T 2
and I-T 2
chicken I-T 2
( O 0
usually O 0
the O 0
waiters B-T 2
are O 0
kind O 0
enough O 0
to O 0
split O 0
the O 0
dish B-T 2
in O 0
half O 0
so O 0
you O 0
get O 0
to O 0
sample O 0
both O 0
meats B-T 2
) O 0
. O 0

The O 0
Bagels B-T 2
have O 0
an O 0
outstanding B-OP 1
taste O 0
with O 0
a O 0
terrific B-OP 1
texture O 0
, O 0
both O 0
chewy B-OP 1
yet O 0
not O 0
gummy B-OP 1
. O 0

Nevertheless O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
itself O 0
is O 0
pretty O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

crumbled O 0
on O 0
the O 0
plate B-T 2
when O 0
you O 0
touched O 0

took O 0
half O 0
an O 0
hour O 0
to O 0
get O 0
our O 0
check B-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0

since O 0
we O 0
could O 0
sit O 0

have O 0
drinks B-T 2
and O 0

The O 0
design B-T 2

is O 0
just O 0
as O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

He O 0

making O 0
it O 0
one O 0
of O 0
my O 0
regular O 0

The O 0
pizza B-T 2

the O 0
best B-OP 1

thin B-T 2
crusted I-T 2
pizza I-T 2

My O 0
Girlfriend O 0

a O 0

Secondly O 0
, O 0
on O 0
this O 0
night O 0
the O 0
place O 0
was O 0
overwhelmed O 0
by O 0
upper O 0
east O 0
side O 0
ladies O 0
perfume O 0
. O 0

i O 0
have O 0
eaten O 0
here O 0
a O 0
handful O 0
of O 0
times O 0
, O 0
for O 0
no O 0
reason O 0
besides O 0
sheer O 0
convenience O 0
. O 0

Obviously O 0
run O 0
by O 0
folks O 0
who O 0
know O 0
a O 0
pie O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
very O 0
disappointed O 0
. O 0

IT O 0
IS O 0
DEFINITELY O 0
SPECIAL O 0
AND O 0
AFFORDABLE O 0
. O 0

I O 0
really O 0
liked O 0
this O 0
place O 0
. O 0

I O 0
will O 0
be O 0
going O 0
back O 0
very O 0
soon O 0

All O 0
the O 0

went O 0
into O 0
the O 0
interior B-T 2
decoration I-T 2
, O 0
none O 0
of O 0
it O 0
went O 0
to O 0
the O 0
chefs B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
seats B-T 2
are O 0
uncomfortable B-OP 1
if O 0

on O 0
wooden O 0
benches O 0

a O 0

'll O 0
want O 0

The O 0
cuisine B-T 2
from O 0
what O 0
I O 0
've O 0
gathered O 0
is O 0
authentic O 0
Taiwanese O 0
, O 0
though O 0
its O 0
very O 0
different B-OP 1
from O 0
what O 0
I O 0
've O 0

accustomed O 0
to O 0

I O 0
almost O 0
hesititate O 0
to O 0
write O 0
a O 0
review O 0
because O 0
the O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
great B-OP 1
and O 0
I O 0
would O 0
hate O 0
for O 0
it O 0
too O 0
become O 0
to O 0
crowded O 0
. O 0

They O 0
are O 0
often O 0
crowded B-T 2
on O 0
the O 0
weekends O 0
but O 0
they O 0
are O 0
efficient B-OP 1
and O 0
accurate B-OP 1
with O 0
their O 0

All O 0
my O 0

were O 0
amazed O 0
at O 0
how O 0
small B-OP 1
the O 0
dish B-T 2
was O 0
. O 0

The O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
is O 0
unheralded O 0
, O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
impecible O 0

so O 0
infused O 0
with O 0

, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
difficult B-OP 1
to I-OP 1
eat I-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
wait B-T 2
staff I-T 2
is O 0
friendly B-OP 1

This O 0
place O 0
, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
only O 0
a O 0
few O 0
months O 0
old O 0
, O 0
is O 0
perhaps O 0
Queens O 0

biggest O 0

It O 0
may O 0
be O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
packed B-T 2
on O 0
weekends O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
vibe B-T 2
is O 0
good B-OP 1
and O 0
it O 0
is O 0
the O 0
best O 0
French B-T 2

Went O 0

delivery B-T 2
and O 0
the O 0

half O 0

Our O 0
server B-T 2
checked O 0
on O 0
us O 0
maybe O 0
twice O 0
during O 0
the O 0
entire O 0
meal B-T 2
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
jus O 0
too O 0
good O 0

have O 0
been O 0

Montparnasse O 0
many O 0
times O 0
and O 0
return O 0
often O 0
for O 0
good O 0
reason O 0
. O 0

The O 0
strong B-OP 1
scents B-T 2
coming O 0
from O 0
the O 0
left O 0
and O 0
right O 0
of O 0
me O 0
negatively O 0
affected O 0
my O 0
taste O 0
buds O 0
. O 0

We O 0
had O 0
the O 0
lobster B-T 2
sandwich I-T 2
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
FANTASTIC B-OP 1
. O 0

It O 0
's O 0
somewhere O 0
you O 0
can O 0
eat O 0
and O 0
be O 0
happy O 0
. O 0

If O 0
you O 0
wrote O 0
a O 0
bad O 0
review O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
because O 0
you O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
understand O 0
what O 0
Rao O 0

is O 0
all O 0
about O 0

Had O 0
we O 0
been O 0
stalling O 0
I O 0
could O 0
understand O 0
where O 0
they O 0
were O 0
coming O 0
from O 0
, O 0
but O 0
we O 0
had O 0
been O 0
there O 0
less O 0
than O 0
an O 0
hour O 0
and O 0
they O 0
had O 0
n't O 0
even O 0
brought O 0

Amma O 0

the O 0
worst O 0

I O 0
have O 0
experienced O 0
in O 0
NYC O 0
over O 0
the O 0
past O 0
2 O 0

I O 0
am O 0

when O 0
it O 0
comes O 0
to O 0
Thai B-T 2
food I-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
my O 0
friend O 0
who O 0
took O 0
me O 0
there O 0
is O 0
. O 0

I O 0
think O 0
this O 0
would O 0
be O 0
a O 0
pretty O 0
good O 0
spot O 0
if O 0
it O 0
were O 0
not O 0
so O 0
overpriced O 0
and O 0
overrated O 0
. O 0

Regardless O 0
of O 0
whether O 0
there O 0
are O 0
two O 0
people O 0
or O 0
two O 0
hundred O 0
people O 0
ahead O 0
of O 0
you O 0
the O 0
hostess B-T 2
will O 0
take O 0
your O 0
name O 0
and O 0
tell O 0
you O 0
Five O 0
minutes O 0
. O 0

The O 0
pizza B-T 2
is O 0
good B-OP 1
though O 0
. O 0

bottles B-T 2
of I-T 2
wine I-T 2
are O 0
cheap B-OP 1
and O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

You O 0
will O 0
not O 0
be O 0
disapointed O 0
at O 0
all O 0
. O 0

Walk-ins O 0
are O 0
risky O 0
too O 0
. O 0

The O 0
have O 0
over O 0
100 O 0
different O 0
beers B-T 2

so O 0
that O 0
made O 0
my O 0
husband O 0
very O 0
happy B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
delicious O 0
, O 0
if O 0
I O 0
must O 0
recommend O 0
a O 0
dish B-T 2
it O 0
must O 0
be O 0
the O 0
pumkin B-T 2
tortelini I-T 2
. O 0

They O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
give O 0
us O 0
the O 0
dinner B-T 2
special I-T 2
until O 0
we O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
it O 0
. O 0

You O 0
must O 0
have O 0
the O 0
crabmeat B-T 2
lasagna I-T 2
which O 0
is O 0
out B-OP 1
of I-OP 1
this I-OP 1
world I-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
chocolate B-T 2
bread I-T 2

leave O 0
until O 0

've O 0
had O 0
the O 0
tiramisu B-T 2
. O 0

Very O 0
good B-OP 1
service B-T 2
and O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
prices B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
recently O 0
went O 0
to O 0
this O 0
restaurant O 0
with O 0
some O 0
co-workers O 0
for O 0
lunch B-T 2
and O 0
had O 0
an O 0
amazing B-OP 1
time O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
impeccable B-OP 1
and O 0
unobtrusive B-OP 1
-- O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
knows O 0
what O 0
they O 0
are O 0
there O 0
to O 0
do O 0
-- O 0
to O 0
know O 0
their O 0

Ess-A-Bagel O 0
( O 0
either O 0
by O 0
Sty-town O 0
or O 0
midtown O 0
) O 0
is O 0
by O 0
far O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
bagel B-T 2
in O 0
NY O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
too O 0

I O 0
ever O 0
got O 0
there O 0
and O 0
I O 0
'm O 0
a O 0
night O 0
person O 0
) O 0

The O 0
most O 0
annoying B-OP 1
thing O 0
, O 0
though O 0
, O 0
is O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0
the O 0
servers B-T 2
seem O 0
to O 0
be O 0
trained O 0
to O 0
drive O 0
revenue O 0
. O 0

Get O 0
your O 0
food B-T 2
to O 0
go O 0
, O 0
find O 0
a O 0
bench O 0
, O 0
and O 0
kick O 0
back O 0
with O 0
a O 0
plate B-T 2
of I-T 2
dumplings I-T 2
. O 0

Please O 0
try O 0
the O 0
Filet B-T 2
Mignon I-T 2
, O 0
its O 0
just O 0
the O 0
most O 0
tender B-OP 1
piece O 0
ever O 0
. O 0

Everything O 0
we O 0
had O 0
was O 0
pretty O 0
good O 0
, O 0
but O 0
we O 0
have O 0
only O 0
been O 0
there O 0
once O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
still O 0
sitting O 0
at O 0
the O 0
bar B-T 2
while O 0
we O 0
drank O 0
the O 0
sangria B-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
facing O 0
away O 0
from O 0
the O 0
bar B-T 2
when O 0
we O 0
turned O 0
back O 0
around O 0
, O 0
the O 0
$ O 0
2 O 0
was O 0
gone O 0
the O 0
people O 0
next O 0
to O 0
us O 0
said O 0
the O 0
bartender B-T 2
took O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Something O 0
about O 0
them O 0
being O 0
busy O 0
with O 0
holiday O 0
party O 0
's O 0
. O 0

The O 0
sake B-T 2
menu I-T 2
should O 0
not O 0
be O 0
overlooked B-OP 1
! O 0

I O 0
would O 0
highly O 0
recommend O 0
. O 0

This O 0
place O 0
is O 0
great O 0
. O 0

the O 0
drinks B-T 2
are O 0
amazing B-OP 1
and O 0
half O 0
off O 0
till O 0
8pm O 0
. O 0

i O 0
've O 0
been O 0
back O 0
to O 0
nha O 0
trang O 0
literally O 0
a O 0
hundred O 0
times O 0
for O 0
the O 0
beef B-T 2
cubes I-T 2
- O 0
they O 0
're O 0
that O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

With O 0
so O 0
many O 0
poor O 0
experiences O 0
to O 0
be O 0
had O 0
in O 0
the O 0
theater O 0
district O 0
, O 0
is O 0
truly O 0
an O 0
excellent O 0
find O 0
! O 0

This O 0
has O 0
got O 0
to O 0
be O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
most O 0
overrated O 0
restaurants O 0
in O 0
Brooklyn O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
, O 0
wine B-T 2
selection I-T 2
, O 0
ambiance B-T 2
are O 0
all O 0
outstanding B-OP 1
and O 0
deserve O 0
recognition O 0
. O 0

Went O 0
there O 0
last O 0
night O 0
for O 0
2 O 0
year O 0
anniversery O 0
, O 0
and O 0
was O 0
n't O 0
all O 0
that O 0
impressed O 0
. O 0

It O 0
was O 0
rather O 0
pathetic O 0
that O 0
it O 0
took O 0
them O 0
over O 0
an O 0
hour O 0
to O 0
seat O 0
us O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
seated O 0
promptly O 0
as O 0
we O 0
had O 0
reservations B-T 2
, O 0
however O 0
after O 0
that O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
slow B-OP 1
. O 0

At O 0
first O 0
I O 0
was O 0
slightly O 0
skeptical O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0
sushi O 0
restaurant O 0
in O 0
the O 0
middle O 0
of O 0
NYC O 0
. O 0

It O 0
's O 0
really O 0
also O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
, O 0
is O 0
good B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
waiters B-T 2
are O 0
friendly O 0
. O 0

Suan O 0
was O 0
a O 0
recommendation O 0
that O 0
I O 0
am O 0
glad O 0
we O 0
heeded O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
pretty O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
a O 0
little O 0
flavorless B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
portions B-T 2
very O 0
small O 0
, O 0
including O 0
dessert B-T 2
. O 0

We O 0
visit O 0
at O 0
least O 0
once O 0
a O 0
month O 0
. O 0

It O 0
is O 0
set O 0
far O 0
from O 0
the O 0
small O 0
street O 0
it O 0
's O 0
on O 0
, O 0
and O 0
there O 0
is O 0
no O 0
traffic B-T 2
noise I-T 2
. O 0

Also O 0
, O 0
the O 0
place O 0
is O 0
popular O 0
with O 0
families O 0
, O 0
so O 0
if O 0
you O 0
're O 0
bothered O 0
by O 0
children O 0
running O 0
loose O 0
like O 0
wild O 0
animals O 0
, O 0
come O 0
later O 0
at O 0
night O 0
to O 0
avoid O 0
them O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'll O 0
keep O 0
this O 0
short O 0
. O 0

I O 0
felt O 0
as O 0
though O 0
I O 0
were O 0
eating O 0
in O 0
Paris O 0
. O 0

Lived O 0
in O 0
Shanghai O 0
most O 0
of O 0
my O 0
life O 0
and O 0
thought O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
comparable B-OP 1
to O 0
the O 0
flagship O 0
Green O 0
Bo O 0
restaurant O 0
there O 0
. O 0

I O 0
highly O 0
recommend B-OP 1
Cafe O 0
St O 0
. O 0
Bart O 0
's O 0
for O 0
their O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
the O 0
ambience B-T 2
and O 0
wonderful O 0
service B-T 2
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
not O 0
worth O 0
a O 0
special O 0
trip O 0
. O 0

Nice O 0
value O 0
. O 0

Gigino O 0
's O 0
in O 0
Wagner O 0
Park O 0
is O 0
so O 0
enjoyable O 0
. O 0

And O 0
it O 0
was O 0
quick O 0
which O 0
is O 0
very O 0
important O 0
. O 0

This O 0
is O 0
a O 0
nice O 0
restaurant O 0
if O 0
you O 0
are O 0
looking O 0
for O 0
a O 0
good O 0
place O 0
to O 0
host O 0
an O 0
intimate O 0
dinner B-T 2
meeting I-T 2
with O 0
business O 0
associates O 0
. O 0

All O 0
the O 0
NYU O 0
students O 0
love O 0
this O 0
place O 0
so O 0
it O 0
makes O 0
for O 0
a O 0
fun B-OP 1
young I-OP 1
atmosphere B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
here O 0
does O 0
a O 0
great B-OP 1
service O 0
to O 0
the O 0
name O 0
( O 0
Cantonese B-T 2
that O 0
is O 0
. O 0
. O 0
. O 0
) O 0
. O 0

But O 0
, O 0
nothing B-OP 1
stands I-OP 1
out I-OP 1
about O 0
the O 0
cooking B-T 2
. O 0

Joya O 0
used O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
cool O 0
spot O 0
with O 0
decent B-OP 1
food B-T 2
and O 0
a O 0
colorful O 0
- O 0
if O 0
not O 0
relaxed O 0
- O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
. O 0

If O 0
that O 0
's O 0
a O 0
problem O 0
, O 0
go O 0
to O 0
McDonald O 0
's O 0
and O 0
destroy O 0
your O 0
insides O 0
. O 0

The O 0
Prix B-T 2
Fixe I-T 2
menu I-T 2
is O 0
worth B-OP 1
every O 0
penny O 0
and O 0
you O 0
get O 0
more O 0
than O 0
enough O 0
( O 0
both O 0
in O 0
quantity B-T 2
AND O 0
quality B-T 2
) O 0
. O 0

I O 0
've O 0
been O 0
here O 0
3 O 0
times O 0
for O 0
lunch B-T 2
and O 0
it O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
my O 0
favorites O 0
in O 0
the O 0
city O 0
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
their O 0
eggs B-T 2
benedict I-T 2
for O 0
brunch B-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
were O 0
the O 0
worst B-OP 1
in O 0
my O 0
entire O 0
life O 0
, O 0
I O 0
tried O 0
removing O 0
the O 0
hollondaise B-T 2
sauce I-T 2
completely O 0
that O 0
was O 0
how O 0
failed O 0
it O 0
was O 0
. O 0

I O 0
work O 0
near-by O 0
, O 0
and O 0
they O 0
have O 0
the O 0
BEST B-OP 1
oatmeal B-T 2
in O 0
the O 0
neighborhood- O 0
not O 0
a O 0
packaged O 0
or O 0
quick-cooked O 0
item O 0
. O 0

Always O 0
busy O 0
but O 0
fast O 0
moving O 0
. O 0

Too O 0
bad B-OP 1
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
n't O 0
of O 0
the O 0
same O 0
heritage O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
looked O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
except O 0
for O 0
offering O 0
the O 0
Chilean B-T 2
Sea I-T 2
Bass I-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
server B-T 2
does O 0
not O 0
offer O 0
up O 0
the O 0
specials B-T 2

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
really O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
I O 0
had O 0
the O 0
onion B-T 2
soup I-T 2
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
best O 0
ever O 0
. O 0

I O 0
will O 0
have O 0
to O 0
say O 0
, O 0
this O 0
Bengali O 0
Fast O 0
Food O 0
joint O 0
is O 0
clearly O 0
my O 0
favorite O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
not O 0
picky O 0
- O 0
but O 0
it O 0
was O 0
actually O 0
gross O 0
. O 0

overall O 0
, O 0
a O 0
solid O 0
restaurant O 0
and O 0
at O 0
less O 0
than O 0
$ O 0
40pp O 0
( O 0
including O 0
wine B-T 2
) O 0
, O 0
a O 0
solid O 0
deal O 0
as O 0
well O 0
. O 0

Since O 0
it O 0
literally O 0
is O 0
a O 0
complete O 0
hole O 0
in O 0
the O 0
wall O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
intimidating O 0
at O 0
first O 0
, O 0
but O 0
you O 0
get O 0
over O 0
that O 0
very O 0
quickly O 0
as O 0
soon O 0
as O 0
the O 0
friendly B-OP 1
staff B-T 2
welcomes O 0
you O 0
- O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
hesitate O 0
to O 0
ask O 0
for O 0
help O 0
with O 0
what O 0
to O 0
get O 0
. O 0

Based O 0
on O 0
the O 0
reviews O 0
for O 0
dinner B-T 2
, O 0
this O 0
is O 0
a O 0
place O 0
I O 0
would O 0
reconsider O 0
revisiting O 0
for O 0
that O 0
, O 0
but O 0
definitely O 0
not O 0
for O 0
Dim B-T 2
Sum I-T 2
again O 0
. O 0

It O 0
costs O 0
$ O 0
2 O 0
extra O 0
to O 0
turn O 0
a O 0
regular O 0
roll B-T 2
into O 0
an O 0
inside-out O 0
roll B-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
roll B-T 2
more O 0
than O 0
triples O 0
in O 0
size O 0
, O 0
and O 0
that O 0
's O 0
not O 0
just O 0
from O 0
the O 0
rice B-T 2
. O 0

Even O 0
with O 0
John O 0
's O 0
and O 0
Joe O 0
's O 0
around O 0
the O 0
corner O 0
, O 0
this O 0
place O 0
will O 0
make O 0
a O 0
name O 0
for O 0
itself O 0
. O 0

It O 0
melted O 0
in O 0
my O 0
little O 0
mouth O 0
and O 0
the O 0
perfect O 0
consistency-not O 0
too O 0
fishy O 0
, O 0
creamy O 0
, O 0
and O 0
slightly O 0
buttery O 0
. O 0

When O 0
he O 0
finally O 0
did O 0
, O 0
he O 0
was O 0
unable B-OP 1
to O 0
make O 0
a O 0
gin B-T 2
and I-T 2
tonic I-T 2
-- O 0
could O 0
n't O 0
find O 0
tonic B-T 2
. O 0

My O 0
girlfriend O 0
convinced O 0
me O 0
to O 0
go O 0
in O 0
the O 0
other O 0
night O 0
for O 0
a O 0
quick O 0
bite O 0
. O 0

The O 0
dim B-T 2
sum I-T 2
is O 0
ok B-OP 1
but O 0
does O 0
n't O 0
taste O 0
that O 0
fresh O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
little B-T 2
dishes I-T 2
do O 0
n't O 0
look O 0
steamy O 0
hot O 0
as O 0
they O 0
should O 0
( O 0
also O 0
note O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
Chinese O 0
here O 0
) O 0
. O 0

despite O 0
the O 0
untasteful O 0
previous O 0
review O 0
. O 0
. O 0
. O 0

Do O 0
n't O 0
judge O 0
this O 0
place O 0
prima O 0

, O 0
you O 0
have O 0
to O 0
try O 0
it O 0
to O 0
believe O 0
it O 0
, O 0
a O 0
home O 0
away O 0
from O 0

for O 0
the O 0

heart O 0
. O 0

Sure O 0
, O 0
everyone O 0

to O 0
know O 0
Sal O 0
, O 0
is O 0
to O 0
know O 0
New O 0
York O 0
. O 0

I O 0
think O 0
that O 0
it O 0
is O 0
absolutely O 0
brilliant O 0
and O 0
well O 0
runned O 0
business O 0
operation O 0
. O 0

Also O 0
they O 0
were O 0
$ O 0
15 O 0
each O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
is O 0
ok B-OP 1
, O 0
some O 0
of O 0
the O 0
people O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
get O 0
what O 0
they O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
. O 0

My O 0
friends O 0
spoke O 0
so O 0
much O 0
about O 0
it O 0
for O 0
months O 0
, O 0
I O 0
finally O 0
made O 0
the O 0
time O 0
to O 0
come O 0
down O 0

If O 0

good B-OP 1
authentic I-OP 1
Thai B-T 2
this O 0
place O 0
is O 0
not O 0
the O 0
place O 0
to O 0

I O 0
recommend B-OP 1
getting O 0
a O 0
reservation B-T 2
even O 0
though O 0
we O 0
saw O 0
people O 0
seated O 0
without O 0

The O 0
only O 0
thing O 0
I O 0
moderately O 0

their O 0

If O 0
you O 0
want O 0

try O 0
them O 0
out O 0
! O 0

you O 0
leave O 0
feeling O 0

missed O 0
the O 0

Authentic O 0

tasty B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
suggest B-OP 1
only O 0
eating O 0
one O 0
with O 0
meat B-T 2
because O 0
they O 0
tend O 0
not O 0
to O 0
mesh O 0
that O 0
well O 0
with O 0
the O 0
average O 0
American O 0

Somewhat O 0
pricey O 0

what O 0
the O 0
heck O 0

It O 0
's O 0
true O 0
, O 0
this O 0
place O 0
is O 0
not O 0

Try B-OP 1
the O 0

're O 0
snappy B-OP 1

the O 0
least O 0

When O 0

This O 0
place O 0
would B-OP 1
be I-OP 1

much I-OP 1
better I-OP 1
served B-T 2
by O 0
being O 0

- O 0
definitely O 0
try O 0
the O 0
striped B-T 2
bass I-T 2

The O 0
music B-T 2
does O 0
get O 0
a O 0
little O 0
loud B-OP 1
at O 0
times O 0
, O 0
but O 0
it O 0
just O 0
made O 0

get O 0
the O 0
maximum O 0
amount O 0
of O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
o O 0
.k O 0
. B-OP 1
, I-OP 1
but O 0
not B-OP 1
any I-OP 1

you O 0
get O 0
at O 0
a O 0
good O 0
neighborhood O 0
restaurant O 0
. B-OP 1

We O 0
had O 0
the O 0
pot-stickers B-T 2
which O 0
were O 0
great B-OP 1

a O 0
tempura B-T 2

that O 0
was O 0
great B-OP 1

I O 0
think O 0
the O 0
stuff B-T 2
was O 0
better B-OP 1

After O 0
reading O 0
the O 0
good O 0

of O 0

decided O 0
to O 0
give O 0
it O 0
a O 0
try O 0
with O 0
two O 0
friends O 0

While O 0
the O 0
$ O 0
20 O 0

is O 0
not O 0
overly O 0
expensive O 0

is O 0
definitely O 0
better B-OP 1

in O 0
that O 0

and O 0
so O 0
Sapphire O 0
, O 0
despite O 0
it O 0
's O 0
lovely O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
, O 0
will O 0
most O 0

I O 0

were O 0
floored B-OP 1
by O 0
the O 0
Octopus B-T 2

. O 0

We O 0

too B-OP 1
much I-OP 1
of O 0
MSG B-T 2

. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
at O 0

And O 0
the O 0
Tom B-T 2
Kha I-T 2

pathetic B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
started O 0
out O 0
with O 0
a O 0
Bombay B-T 2
beer I-T 2

was O 0
big B-OP 1
enough O 0
for O 0
two O 0
. O 0

The O 0
decor B-T 2
is O 0
vibrant B-OP 1
and O 0
eye-pleasing B-OP 1
with O 0
several O 0
semi-private B-T 2
boths I-T 2
on O 0
the O 0
right O 0

of O 0
the O 0

Tends O 0

We O 0
thought O 0
this O 0
a O 0
prelude O 0
to O 0
what O 0
the O 0
evening O 0
will O 0
be O 0
like O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0

Drawbacks O 0

Zucchero O 0
Pomodori O 0

lamb B-T 2
chettinad I-T 2
and O 0
the O 0

We O 0
were O 0
planning O 0
to O 0
get O 0
dessert B-T 2

the O 0
waitress B-T 2
basically O 0
through O 0
the O 0
bill B-T 2
at O 0
us O 0
before O 0
we O 0
had O 0
a O 0
chance O 0

Really O 0

I O 0
really O 0
loved O 0
the O 0
different B-OP 1

the O 0
cheff B-T 2

They O 0
came O 0
out O 0
over O 0
cooked O 0
and O 0
the O 0
cheese B-T 2
was O 0
almost O 0
non B-OP 1
existant I-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
a O 0
terrific B-OP 1
meal B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
our O 0
server B-T 2
guided O 0
us O 0
toward O 0
a O 0
very O 0
nice O 0
wine B-T 2
in O 0
our O 0
price B-T 2
range O 0
, O 0
instead O 0
of O 0
allowing O 0
us O 0
to O 0
purchase O 0
a O 0
similarly O 0
priced B-T 2
wine I-T 2
that O 0
was O 0
n't O 0
as O 0
good O 0
. O 0

The O 0
svc B-T 2
can O 0
be O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
rude B-OP 1
at O 0
times O 0
, O 0
esp O 0
if O 0
you O 0
have O 0
big O 0
group O 0
, O 0
but O 0
overall O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
is O 0
a O 0
must O 0
! O 0

My O 0
husband O 0
and O 0
I O 0
thougt O 0
it O 0
would O 0

Never O 0
once O 0
did O 0
I O 0
leave O 0
feeling O 0
unwelcome O 0
or O 0
impressed O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
especially O 0
their O 0
more O 0
basic O 0
dishes B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
drinks B-T 2
are O 0
delicious O 0
. O 0

But O 0
the O 0
main O 0
hit B-OP 1
was O 0
the O 0
whole B-T 2
grilled I-T 2
fish I-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
the O 0
tuna B-T 2

On O 0
a O 0
hot O 0
day O 0
it O 0
was O 0
fabulous B-OP 1
to O 0
stop O 0
in O 0
and O 0
enjoy B-OP 1
lunch B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
delicious B-OP 1
and O 0
beautifully B-OP 1
prepared I-OP 1
along O 0
with O 0
the O 0
friendly O 0
and O 0
personable O 0
service B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
usually O 0
go O 0
there O 0
later O 0
at O 0
night O 0
when O 0
I O 0
get O 0
off O 0
work O 0
so O 0
I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
to O 0
deal O 0
with O 0
crowds B-T 2
or O 0
lines B-T 2
. O 0

Pizza B-T 2
here O 0
is O 0
consistently O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

We O 0
had O 0
a O 0
great B-OP 1
tiem O 0
watching O 0
the O 0

just O 0
what O 0
we O 0
were O 0
looking O 0
for O 0

After O 0
2 O 0
tries O 0
by O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
to O 0
take O 0
it O 0
away O 0
( O 0
we O 0
had O 0

, O 0
we O 0
had O 0
full O 0
beers B-T 2
yet O 0
to O 0
drink O 0
) O 0
, O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
approached O 0
and O 0
told O 0
us O 0
they O 0
needed O 0
the O 0
table O 0
for O 0
people O 0
with O 0
reservations B-T 2
. O 0

Would O 0
n't O 0
recomend B-OP 1
it O 0
for O 0
dinner B-T 2
! O 0

Sauce B-T 2
was O 0
watery B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
did O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
much O 0
flavor B-T 2
. O 0

My O 0
husband O 0
and O 0

the O 0
only O 0
place O 0

We O 0
both O 0
opted O 0
for O 0
a O 0
pasta B-T 2
dish I-T 2
and O 0
they O 0
were O 0
served B-OP 1
timely I-OP 1
and O 0
fresh B-OP 1
. O 0

First O 0
the O 0
wrong B-OP 1
bread B-T 2
came O 0
out O 0
with O 0
the O 0
appetizer B-T 2
, O 0
then O 0
when O 0

dined O 0

but O 0
Saul O 0

in O 0
a O 0
great B-OP 1
neighborhood B-T 2
and O 0
has O 0
great B-OP 1
food B-T 2
! O 0

In O 0
an O 0
area O 0
sadly O 0
lacking O 0
in O 0
decent B-OP 1
Thai B-T 2
food I-T 2
, O 0
this O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
best O 0
spots O 0
. O 0

Tell O 0
them O 0
Herky O 0
sent O 0
you O 0
and O 0
get O 0
a O 0
free O 0
confused O 0
look O 0
from O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
. O 0

Make O 0
reservations B-T 2
but O 0
expect O 0
to O 0
be O 0
delayed B-OP 1
15-20 O 0
minutes O 0
as O 0
the O 0
hosting B-T 2
staff I-T 2
was O 0
having O 0
difficulty O 0
seating B-T 2
guests O 0
who O 0
arrived O 0
with O 0
a O 0
reservation B-T 2
because O 0
they O 0
probably O 0
had O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
of O 0
walk O 0
ins O 0
being O 0
so O 0
close O 0
to O 0
Time O 0
Square O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
average B-OP 1
or I-OP 1
above I-OP 1
including O 0
some O 0
surprising O 0
tasty O 0
dishes B-T 2
. O 0

They O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
seem O 0
to O 0
place O 0
an O 0
emphasis O 0
on O 0
specials B-T 2
or O 0
fresh O 0
ingredients B-T 2
which O 0
to O 0
me O 0
is O 0
necessary O 0
for O 0
good B-OP 1
thai B-T 2
. O 0

Other O 0
apetizers B-T 2
and O 0
food B-T 2

The O 0
noodle B-T 2
and I-T 2
rices I-T 2
dishes I-T 2
taste O 0
great B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
's O 0
as O 0
good B-OP 1
as O 0
ever O 0
. O 0

The O 0
crust B-T 2
is O 0
thin B-OP 1
, O 0
the O 0
ingredients B-T 2
are O 0
fresh O 0
and O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2
is O 0
friendly O 0
. O 0

Your O 0
friends O 0
will O 0
thank O 0
you O 0
for O 0
introducing O 0
them O 0
to O 0
this O 0
gem O 0
! O 0

Also O 0
a O 0
little O 0
more O 0
expensive B-OP 1
than O 0
your O 0
average O 0
bagel B-T 2
place O 0
. O 0

the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
undercooked-the O 0
sauce B-T 2
watery O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
vegetables B-T 2
raw O 0
. O 0

And O 0
the O 0
fried B-T 2
clams I-T 2
had O 0
just O 0
enough B-OP 1
kick O 0
to O 0
them O 0
to O 0
make O 0
'em O 0
worth O 0
eating O 0
. O 0

The O 0
sauces B-T 2
used O 0
are O 0
also O 0
not B-OP 1
that I-OP 1
exciting I-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
secret B-OP 1
is O 0
the O 0
lunch B-T 2
menu I-T 2
which O 0
offers O 0
a O 0
complimentary O 0
appetizer B-T 2
with O 0
every O 0
entree B-T 2
ordered O 0
. O 0

I O 0
absolutely O 0
love O 0
this O 0
place O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

The O 0
rice B-T 2
was O 0
poor B-OP 1
quality I-OP 1
and O 0
was O 0
cooked B-OP 1
so I-OP 1
badly I-OP 1
it O 0
was O 0
hard B-OP 1
. O 0

We O 0
had O 0
champagne B-T 2
and O 0
caviar B-T 2
and O 0
felt O 0
like O 0
princesses O 0
! O 0

The O 0
shrimp B-T 2
scampi I-T 2
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
antipasti B-T 2
were O 0
plentiful O 0
. O 0

I O 0
am O 0
surprised O 0
to O 0
say O 0
the O 0
least O 0
and O 0
find O 0
such O 0
practice O 0
not O 0
worth O 0
the O 0
effort O 0
. O 0

When O 0
my O 0
dessert B-T 2
came O 0
, O 0
there O 0
was O 0
a O 0
candle O 0
in O 0
it O 0
- O 0
not O 0
because O 0
anyone O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
one O 0
- O 0
but O 0
because O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
must O 0
have O 0
seen O 0
me O 0
opening O 0
my O 0
birthday O 0
card O 0
and O 0
gift O 0
, O 0
and O 0
said O 0
he O 0
knew O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0
special O 0
occassion O 0
of O 0
some O 0
sort O 0
. O 0

I O 0
got O 0
the O 0

10 O 0
10-piece O 0
dim B-T 2
sum I-T 2
combo I-T 2
, O 0
every O 0
bite O 0
of O 0
which O 0
was O 0
great B-OP 1
. O 0

There O 0
are O 0
other O 0
Vietnamese O 0
restaurants O 0
in O 0
the O 0
chinatown O 0
area O 0
and O 0
you O 0
can O 0
forget O 0
about O 0
those O 0
. O 0

There O 0
is O 0
also O 0
very O 0
limited B-OP 1
seating B-T 2
and O 0
there O 0
can O 0
be O 0
a O 0
substantial O 0
wait B-T 2
in O 0
getting O 0

hot O 0
in O 0

they O 0
do O 0
put O 0
some O 0
cash O 0
into O 0
the O 0
bagels B-T 2

because O 0
they O 0
among O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1

the O 0
city O 0
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0

may O 0
skew O 0
this O 0
reviewer O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
tasty B-OP 1

spicy B-OP 1
sans O 0
the O 0
oil B-T 2
that O 0
comes O 0
floating O 0
along O 0
at O 0
similar O 0
venues O 0
. O 0

The O 0
portions B-T 2
are O 0
now O 0
very O 0
small O 0
, O 0
the O 0
sauces B-T 2
are O 0
overly-ambitious O 0
usually O 0
inedible O 0
while O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
is O 0
still O 0
good O 0
, O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
, O 0
due O 0
to O 0
its O 0
popularity O 0
, O 0
seems O 0
frantic O 0
. O 0

For O 0
the O 0
price B-T 2
, O 0
you O 0
can O 0
not O 0
eat O 0
this O 0
well O 0
in O 0

with O 0
a O 0
group O 0
, O 0
and O 0
kids O 0
( O 0
6 O 0
and O 0
over O 0

would O 0
love O 0
it O 0

With O 0
so O 0
many O 0
good O 0
restaurants O 0
on O 0
the O 0
UWS O 0
, O 0
I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
need O 0
overpriced B-OP 1
food B-T 2
, O 0
absurdly O 0
arrogant O 0
wait-staff B-T 2
who O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
recognize O 0
they O 0
work O 0
at O 0
a O 0
glorified O 0
diner B-T 2
, O 0
clumsy O 0
service B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
management B-T 2
that O 0
does O 0
n't O 0
care O 0
. O 0

I O 0
tend O 0
to O 0
judge O 0
a O 0
sushi O 0
restaurant O 0
by O 0
its O 0
sea B-T 2
urchin I-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
heavenly B-OP 1
at O 0
sushi O 0
rose O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
is O 0
a O 0
little O 0
scatty B-OP 1
at O 0
times O 0
but O 0
all O 0
is O 0
forgiven O 0
when O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
arrives O 0
. O 0

The O 0
bruscetta B-T 2
is O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
soggy B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
salads B-T 2
were O 0
fresh O 0
, O 0
included O 0
a O 0
nice O 0
mix B-T 2
of I-T 2
greens I-T 2
( O 0
not O 0
iceberg B-T 2
) O 0
all O 0
dishes B-T 2
are O 0
served B-T 2
piping O 0
hot O 0
from O 0
the O 0
kitchen O 0
. O 0

And O 0
evaluated O 0
on O 0
those O 0
terms O 0
Pastis O 0
is O 0
simply O 0
wonderful O 0
. O 0

The O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
is B-OP 1
n't I-OP 1
the I-OP 1
greatest I-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
suppose O 0
that O 0
's O 0
how O 0
they O 0
keep O 0
the B-OP 1
prices B-T 2
down O 0
. O 0

The O 0
pickles B-T 2
were O 0
great B-OP 1
addition O 0
. O 0

and O 0
it O 0
felt O 0
like O 0

However O 0
, O 0
it O 0

an O 0
even O 0
more O 0
amazing O 0
place O 0
just O 0

In O 0
reality O 0
( O 0
to O 0
maximize O 0
potential O 0
diners B-T 2
) O 0
they O 0
were O 0
still O 0
taking O 0
phone O 0
reservations B-T 2
and O 0
reallocating O 0
tables B-T 2
of O 0
those O 0
waiting B-T 2
in O 0
the O 0

The O 0

there O 0
's O 0
always O 0
someone O 0
to O 0
take O 0
that O 0
empty O 0
seat B-T 2
, O 0
so O 0
it O 0
seems O 0
that O 0
customer O 0
service B-T 2
has O 0
been O 0
deemed O 0
not O 0
of O 0
the O 0
essence O 0
. O 0

Dinner B-T 2
took O 0
almost O 0
4 O 0
hours O 0
without O 0
any O 0

The O 0
people B-T 2

a O 0
sometimes O 0
kind O 0
of O 0

And O 0
at O 0
the O 0
conclusion O 0
of B-T 2
this O 0
culinary O 0
nightmare O 0
the O 0
check B-T 2
was O 0
given O 0

so O 0
on O 0

, O 0
it O 0
can O 0
be O 0

Oh O 0
and O 0
it O 0

too O 0
tiny O 0
for O 0

With O 0
the O 0
exception O 0
of O 0
our O 0
lemon B-T 2

Admittedly O 0
some O 0

even O 0
took O 0
a O 0

who O 0
said O 0
it O 0
was O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
best O 0
sushi B-T 2
places I-T 2
in O 0
the O 0
US O 0
that O 0

. O 0

I O 0
brought O 0
some O 0
buddies O 0
from O 0
CA O 0
and O 0
they O 0
loved O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Inside O 0
is O 0
a O 0
little O 0
cramped O 0
, O 0
but O 0
to O 0
be O 0
expected O 0
. O 0

Sushi B-T 2
was O 0
n't O 0
anything O 0
spectacular B-OP 1
for O 0
the O 0
price B-T 2
. O 0

During O 0
our O 0
meal B-T 2
, O 0
the O 0
management B-T 2
came O 0
over O 0
and O 0
checked O 0
on O 0
us O 0
and O 0
even O 0
bought O 0
us O 0
a O 0
round B-T 2
of I-T 2
drinks I-T 2
. O 0

But O 0
they O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
a O 0
toaster B-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
is O 0
strange B-OP 1
. O 0

So O 0
, O 0
for O 0
good B-OP 1
food B-T 2
i O 0
'd O 0
recommend B-OP 1
it O 0
, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
for O 0
a O 0
fun O 0
night O 0
out O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
choices I-T 2
are O 0
similar O 0
but O 0
the O 0
taste B-T 2
lacked B-OP 1
more O 0
flavor B-T 2
than O 0
it O 0
looked O 0
. O 0

A O 0
must B-OP 1
for O 0
all O 0
the O 0
Dosa B-T 2
lovers O 0
. O 0

The O 0
portions B-T 2
are O 0
HUGE B-OP 1
, O 0
so O 0
it O 0
might O 0
be O 0
good O 0
to O 0
order O 0
three O 0
things O 0
to O 0
split O 0
( O 0
rather O 0
than O 0
one O 0
appetizer B-T 2
and O 0

per O 0
person O 0
) O 0
for O 0
two O 0
people O 0
. O 0

The O 0
appetizers B-T 2
are O 0
just O 0
OK B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
main B-T 2
courses I-T 2
were O 0
decidedly O 0
subpar O 0
. O 0

Someone O 0
else O 0
recommended B-OP 1
the O 0
dessert B-T 2
- O 0
we O 0
also O 0
left O 0
that O 0

The O 0
exotic B-T 2

The O 0
staff B-T 2

attentive B-OP 1
and O 0
we O 0
can O 0
almost O 0
always O 0
get O 0

Best B-OP 1
dish B-T 2
is O 0

doing O 0
you O 0
a O 0
favor O 0
to O 0

excellent B-OP 1
alternative O 0
to O 0
fast B-T 2
food I-T 2
joints O 0
and O 0
ordering O 0
in O 0
but O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
slightly O 0
disappointing B-OP 1
. O 0

Mermaid O 0

an O 0
overall O 0
good B-OP 1
restaurant O 0
with O 0
really O 0
good B-OP 1
seafood B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
work O 0
around O 0
the O 0
corner O 0
and O 0
tried O 0
it O 0
with O 0
a O 0
colleague O 0
for O 0
the O 0
first O 0
time O 0
. O 0

I O 0
went O 0
here O 0
with O 0
my O 0

. O 0

The O 0

eat I-T 2
deal I-T 2
is O 0
truly O 0
amazing B-OP 1
here O 0
. O 0

That O 0
is O 0
a O 0
problem O 0
since O 0
we O 0
paid O 0
about O 0
20 O 0
bucks O 0
a O 0
dish B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
had O 0

order O 0
5 O 0
dishes B-T 2

get O 0
a O 0
decent B-OP 1

This O 0
is O 0
definitely O 0
a O 0
place O 0
that O 0
provides O 0
the O 0
best O 0
experience O 0
, O 0
though O 0
, O 0
to O 0
both O 0
A-listers O 0
and O 0
people O 0
walking O 0
in O 0
off O 0
the O 0
street O 0

They O 0
were O 0
such O 0
a O 0
rip-off B-OP 1
( O 0
$ O 0
8 O 0
.95 O 0
for O 0
four O 0
small O 0
meat B-T 2
patties I-T 2
in I-T 2
steamed I-T 2
buns I-T 2
) O 0
and O 0
not B-OP 1
worth I-OP 1
trying I-OP 1
. O 0

first O 0
it O 0
took O 0
us O 0
a O 0
long O 0
time O 0
to O 0
find O 0
the O 0
place O 0
. O 0

All O 0
of O 0
the O 0
pizzas B-T 2
are O 0
terrific B-OP 1

even O 0
better O 0
! O 0

It O 0
is O 0
about O 0
FOOD B-T 2
and O 0
Ambiance B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
imagine O 0
how O 0
dreadful B-OP 1

will O 0
be O 0

we O 0
only O 0
had O 0
to O 0
listen O 0
to O 0
an O 0
idle O 0

The O 0

Immediately O 0
after O 0
we O 0
paid O 0
, O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
took O 0
the O 0

and O 0
said O 0

how O 0
refreshing B-OP 1

Admittedly O 0

for O 0
people O 0

pay O 0
a O 0

for O 0
mediocre B-OP 1

must O 0
say O 0
how O 0
delicous B-OP 1
the O 0

the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
. O 0

Went O 0

on O 0
the O 0
way O 0

It O 0

leftover O 0
chicken B-T 2
, O 0
poured O 0
oil B-T 2
and O 0
sprinkled O 0
pepper B-T 2
powder I-T 2

( O 0
the O 0
sauce B-T 2
was O 0
translucent O 0

One O 0
would O 0
think O 0
we O 0
'd O 0
get O 0
an O 0
apology O 0
or O 0
complimentary O 0
drinks B-T 2
- O 0
instead O 0
, O 0
we O 0
got O 0
a O 0
snobby B-OP 1
waiter B-T 2
would O 0
n't O 0
even O 0
take O 0
our O 0
order O 0
for O 0
15 O 0
minutes O 0
and O 0
gave O 0
us O 0
lip O 0
when O 0
we O 0
asked O 0
him O 0
to O 0
do O 0
so O 0
. O 0

One O 0
of O 0
my O 0
favorite O 0
places O 0
in O 0
Manhattan O 0
. O 0

They O 0
brought O 0
glasses O 0

the O 0

, O 0
and O 0
just O 0
left O 0
the O 0
bottle O 0
at O 0
our O 0
table O 0
. O 0

We O 0
actually O 0
gave O 0
10 O 0
% O 0
tip B-T 2
( O 0
which O 0
we O 0
have O 0
never O 0
done O 0
despite O 0
mediocre B-OP 1
food B-T 2
and O 0
service B-T 2
) O 0
, O 0
because O 0
we O 0
felt O 0
totally O 0
ripped O 0
off O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
looking O 0
forward O 0
to O 0
nice B-OP 1
glass B-T 2
of I-T 2
Sangria I-T 2
when O 0
we O 0
arrived O 0
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
highly O 0
recommand O 0
requesting O 0
a O 0
table B-T 2
by I-T 2
the I-T 2
window I-T 2
. O 0

While O 0
we O 0
enjoyed B-OP 1
the O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
we O 0
were O 0
highly O 0
disappointed O 0
by O 0
the O 0
poor O 0
service B-T 2
( O 0
waiter B-T 2
was O 0
not O 0
quite O 0
competent O 0
and O 0
SLOW O 0
service B-T 2
) O 0
and O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
remorse O 0
. O 0

I O 0
for O 0
one O 0
will O 0
never O 0
patronize O 0
them O 0
again O 0
. O 0

I O 0
stumbled O 0
upon O 0
this O 0
great O 0
pizzeria O 0
as O 0
I O 0
explored O 0
my O 0
new O 0
neighborhood O 0

After O 0
hearing O 0
a O 0

of O 0
great O 0
things O 0
about O 0
the O 0

, O 0
and O 0
passing O 0
by O 0
it O 0
on O 0
a O 0
daily O 0
basis O 0

we O 0
decided O 0
to O 0
try O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
, O 0
however O 0
, O 0
was O 0
a O 0
bright B-OP 1
flower O 0
in O 0

So O 0
, O 0
again O 0

A O 0

the O 0

, O 0
very O 0
good O 0

n't O 0
much O 0
like O 0
the O 0

that O 0
came O 0
with O 0

the O 0
filet B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
good O 0
, O 0
neither O 0
of O 0

the O 0

, O 0
I O 0
'm O 0
not O 0
quite O 0
sure O 0
if O 0
it O 0

it O 0
the O 0
Michelin O 0

have O 0
displayed O 0
so O 0
prooudly O 0
in O 0

extremely O 0
satisfied O 0

few O 0
Italian O 0
employees B-T 2
who O 0
may O 0
not O 0
speak O 0
the O 0
best O 0
English O 0

still O 0
the O 0
best O 0
Indian O 0
restaurant O 0
around O 0
Union O 0
Square O 0
. O 0

Not O 0
worth B-OP 1
the O 0

We O 0
were O 0
on O 0
our O 0
way O 0
back O 0
to O 0
NJ O 0
, O 0
and O 0
since O 0
I O 0
am O 0
in O 0
NY O 0
, O 0
we O 0
figured O 0
why O 0
not O 0
grab O 0
some O 0
food B-T 2
? O 0

sandwiches B-T 2
tho O 0
pricey B-OP 1
are O 0
over O 0
stuffed B-OP 1
- O 0
can O 0
serve O 0
2 O 0
persons O 0
easily O 0
thus O 0
cost B-OP 1
effective I-OP 1
! O 0

And O 0
comparing O 0
it O 0
to O 0
the O 0
Chinatown O 0
restaurants O 0
is O 0
simply O 0
not O 0
fair O 0
. O 0

Service B-T 2
and O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
what O 0
any O 0
one O 0
would O 0
expect B-OP 1
when O 0
spending O 0
that O 0
type O 0
of O 0
money O 0
. O 0

LOVE B-OP 1
the O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
- O 0
felt O 0
like O 0
I O 0
was O 0
in O 0
Paris O 0
. O 0

Every O 0
course B-T 2
was O 0
better B-OP 1
than O 0
the O 0
next O 0
. O 0

Not O 0
cheap O 0
, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
that O 0
expensive O 0
either O 0
. O 0

The O 0
staff B-T 2
is O 0
incredibly O 0
helpful B-OP 1
and O 0
attentive B-OP 1
. O 0

If O 0
presentation O 0

service B-T 2
is O 0
your O 0
thing O 0
, O 0
then O 0
this O 0
magic O 0
show O 0
works O 0
. O 0

Apparently O 0
, O 0
the O 0
good B-OP 1
cook B-T 2
works O 0
then O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
pleasantly O 0
suprised O 0

The O 0
Yellowtail B-T 2
was O 0
particularly O 0
good B-OP 1

well O 0

were O 0
even O 0
smaller O 0

a O 0

a O 0
basmati B-T 2

all O 0
Japanese O 0

that O 0

overcompensate O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
delicious B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
was O 0
incredibly O 0
helpful O 0
and O 0
attentive O 0
( O 0
considering O 0
we O 0
were O 0
the O 0
only O 0

Definitely O 0
worth O 0
the O 0

to O 0
Battery O 0

City O 0
! O 0

Perhaps O 0
this O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
considered O 0
extreme B-OP 1
to O 0
an O 0
Upper O 0
East O 0
Side O 0
resident O 0
, O 0
but O 0
for O 0
the O 0

of O 0
us O 0
who O 0
've O 0
actually O 0
eaten O 0
ethnic B-T 2
food I-T 2

this O 0

The O 0
place B-T 2
was O 0
real O 0
empty B-OP 1

that O 0
was O 0
because O 0
this O 0
was O 0
the O 0

This O 0

the O 0
sense O 0
that O 0
the O 0

care O 0
about O 0

we O 0
got O 0
was O 0
Thai O 0

They O 0
have O 0
a O 0
huge B-OP 1
selection O 0
of O 0
different B-OP 1
cream B-T 2
cheeses I-T 2
and O 0
all O 0
of O 0
their O 0
salads B-T 2
are O 0
great O 0
. O 0

The O 0
lobster B-T 2
sandwich I-T 2

good B-OP 1
and B-T 2
the O 0
spaghetti B-T 2
with I-T 2
Scallops I-T 2
and I-T 2
Shrimp I-T 2
is O 0
great O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
authentic B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
dim B-T 2
sum I-T 2
is O 0
delectable B-OP 1
while O 0
the O 0
prices B-T 2
are O 0
quite O 0
easy O 0
on O 0
the O 0
wallet O 0
. O 0

I O 0
only O 0
tried O 0
a B-T 2

in I-T 2
a I-T 2
light I-T 2
oil I-T 2
and I-T 2
garlic I-T 2
sauce I-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
it O 0
actually O 0
faired O 0
better B-OP 1
than O 0
most O 0
NYC O 0
Italian O 0
joints O 0
I O 0
've O 0
tried O 0
similar O 0
dishes B-T 2
at O 0

The O 0
worst B-OP 1
excuse O 0
for O 0
Japanese B-T 2
food I-T 2
I O 0
've O 0
ever O 0
encountered O 0
. O 0

A O 0
million O 0

If O 0
celebrities O 0
make O 0
you O 0
sweat O 0
, O 0
then O 0
your O 0
in O 0
for O 0
a O 0
ride O 0
, O 0
but O 0
if O 0
your O 0
like O 0
most O 0
around O 0
these O 0
parts O 0
then O 0
you O 0
'll O 0
just O 0
yawn O 0
and O 0
wonder O 0
whats O 0
with O 0
all O 0
the O 0
hype O 0
. O 0

Okay-i O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
mind O 0
the O 0
oily O 0
part O 0
( O 0
cause O 0
most O 0
are O 0
cooked O 0
that O 0
way O 0
) O 0
but O 0
it O 0
was O 0
way O 0
too O 0
bland O 0
. O 0

I O 0
ordered O 0
a O 0
Chicken B-T 2
Teriyaki I-T 2
dish I-T 2
and O 0
found O 0
that O 0
the O 0
chicken B-T 2
was O 0
extremely O 0
dry B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
love O 0
it O 0
. O 0

If O 0
you O 0
want O 0
something O 0
really O 0
different O 0
than O 0
try O 0
Jekyll O 0
and O 0
Hyde O 0
. O 0

We O 0
had O 0
reservations B-T 2
at O 0
9pm O 0
, O 0
but O 0
was O 0
not O 0
seated O 0
until O 0
10:15pm O 0
. O 0

We O 0
had O 0
Pam B-T 2
's I-T 2
special I-T 2
fried I-T 2
fish I-T 2
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
amazing B-OP 1
. O 0

Its O 0
located O 0
in O 0
greenewich O 0
village O 0
. O 0

There O 0
is O 0
no O 0
excuse O 0
for O 0
such O 0
lousy B-OP 1
service B-T 2
! O 0

Three O 0
strikes O 0
and O 0
this O 0
restaurant O 0
is O 0
out O 0
. O 0

We O 0
bring O 0
in O 0
a O 0
party O 0
of O 0
ten O 0
or O 0
so O 0
every O 0
week O 0
. O 0

My O 0
boyfriend O 0
had O 0
the O 0
New B-T 2
England I-T 2
Chowder I-T 2
it O 0
was O 0
good B-OP 1
but O 0
I O 0
think O 0
the O 0
award O 0
should O 0
go O 0
to O 0
the O 0
Lobster B-T 2
Bisque I-T 2
. O 0

So O 0
, O 0
a O 0
little O 0
inconsistency O 0
there O 0
but O 0
either O 0
way O 0
, O 0
both O 0
pizzas B-T 2
were O 0
really O 0
good B-OP 1
. O 0

Overall O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
is O 0
more O 0
expensive O 0
than O 0
our O 0
other O 0
sushi B-T 2
favorites O 0
, O 0
but O 0
everything O 0
was O 0
delicious O 0
. O 0

We O 0
would O 0
return O 0
to O 0
this O 0
place O 0
again O 0
! O 0

Not B-OP 1
enough I-OP 1
wines B-T 2
by I-T 2

I O 0
had O 0
the O 0
duck B-T 2
breast I-T 2
special I-T 2
on O 0
my O 0
last O 0
visit O 0
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
incredible B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
must O 0
say O 0
it O 0
's O 0
a O 0
little O 0
pricey B-OP 1
for O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
not O 0
as O 0
spectacular O 0
as O 0
the O 0
view O 0
. O 0

These O 0
innovators O 0
of O 0
french B-T 2
indian I-T 2
fusion I-T 2
do O 0
a O 0
great B-OP 1
job O 0
of O 0
making O 0
dishes B-T 2
as O 0
interesting O 0
as O 0
possible O 0
while O 0
still O 0
being O 0

Just O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
take O 0
the O 0
seat B-T 2
between O 0
the O 0
bar B-T 2
and O 0
the O 0
back O 0
half O 0
of O 0

. O 0

No O 0
gimmicks O 0
here O 0
-- O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
speaks O 0
for O 0
itself O 0
in O 0
its O 0
freshness O 0
and O 0
preparation O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
worried O 0
we O 0
would O 0
have O 0
trouble O 0
getting O 0
in O 0
, O 0
but O 0
somehow O 0
managed O 0
to O 0
have O 0
a O 0
short B-OP 1

My O 0

should O 0

The O 0

last O 0

and O 0
I O 0
do O 0
mean O 0
the O 0
last O 0
time O 0

we O 0
were O 0
told O 0
that O 0
they O 0
needed O 0
our O 0
table B-T 2
so O 0
we O 0
would O 0
have O 0

only O 0
get O 0
through O 0
an O 0

the O 0
best B-OP 1

of O 0
my O 0
life O 0
at O 0

My O 0
biggest O 0
complaint O 0
was O 0
the O 0
un-tasty O 0
food B-T 2
although O 0
presented O 0
well O 0
. O 0

This O 0
tiny O 0
restaurant O 0
is O 0
as O 0
cozy O 0
as O 0
it O 0
gets O 0
, O 0
with O 0
that O 0
certain O 0
Parisian O 0

So O 0

Most O 0
importantly O 0
, O 0
food B-T 2

If O 0
we O 0
were O 0
to O 0
move O 0
from O 0
the O 0
upper O 0

side O 0
, O 0
we O 0
would O 0
genuinely O 0
miss O 0
this O 0
restaurant O 0
. O 0

The O 0
best O 0
part O 0
of O 0
the O 0
experience O 0
was O 0
knowing O 0
that O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
( O 0
a O 0
bubbly B-OP 1
, O 0
friendly B-OP 1
young I-OP 1
woman O 0
with O 0
a O 0
great O 0
smile O 0
) O 0
truly O 0
cared O 0
about O 0
how O 0
we O 0
were O 0
doing O 0
. O 0

Ok O 0
, O 0
for O 0
all O 0
of O 0
us O 0
growing O 0
up O 0
in O 0
the O 0
Village O 0
of O 0
NYC O 0
, O 0
we O 0
have O 0
spoiled O 0
by O 0
a O 0
plethora O 0
of O 0
restaurants O 0
, O 0
most O 0
of O 0
which O 0
stay O 0
open O 0
very O 0
late O 0
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
as O 0
plain B-OP 1
as O 0
sesame B-T 2
crusted I-T 2
Salmon I-T 2
I O 0
had O 0
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
highly O 0
recommend O 0
it O 0
. O 0

It O 0
's O 0
great O 0
to O 0
go O 0
for O 0
a O 0
quick B-OP 1
lunch B-T 2
either O 0
alone O 0
or O 0
with O 0
a O 0
friend O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
mediocre B-OP 1
at O 0
best O 0
but O 0
it O 0
was O 0
the O 0
horrible O 0
service B-T 2
that O 0
made O 0
me O 0
vow O 0
never O 0
to O 0
go O 0
back O 0
. O 0

LLOOVVE O 0
THIS O 0
PLACE O 0
. O 0

So O 0
some O 0
of O 0
the O 0
reviews O 0
here O 0
are O 0
accurate O 0
about O 0
the O 0
crowd B-T 2
and O 0
noise B-T 2
. O 0

You O 0
get O 0
what O 0
you O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
and O 0
with O 0
that O 0
logic O 0
in O 0
mind O 0
, O 0
Spice O 0
is O 0
a O 0
great O 0
place O 0
to O 0
grab O 0
some O 0
cheap B-OP 1
eats B-T 2
and O 0
drinks B-T 2
in O 0
a O 0
beautiful O 0
setting B-T 2

be O 0
more O 0

. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
terrible B-OP 1
, O 0
we O 0
had O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
for O 0
everything O 0

ask O 0
several O 0
of O 0
different O 0
people O 0

before O 0

Based O 0
on O 0
the O 0

of O 0
the O 0
yummy B-OP 1
dumplings B-T 2
from O 0
the O 0

The O 0

.and O 0

saying O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
. O 0

those O 0
rolls B-T 2
were O 0
big B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
not B-OP 1
good I-OP 1
and O 0
sashimi B-T 2
was O 0
n't O 0
fresh O 0
. O 0

The O 0
pesto B-T 2
pizza I-T 2
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1
, O 0
thin-crust B-T 2
pizza I-T 2
with O 0
a O 0
nice O 0
amount O 0
of O 0

Italian B-T 2

that O 0
I O 0
'd O 0
never O 0
heard O 0
of O 0
before O 0
. O 0

The O 0
only O 0
thing O 0
I O 0
could O 0
get O 0
attention O 0
from O 0
was O 0
one O 0
of O 0
at O 0
least O 0
two O 0
cats O 0
running O 0
around O 0
that O 0
kept O 0
batting O 0
at O 0
my O 0
table O 0
. O 0

if O 0
your O 0
into O 0
thai O 0
. O 0
.you O 0
can O 0
not O 0
miss O 0
this O 0
great O 0
restaurant O 0
. O 0

Going O 0
to O 0
Ballato O 0
's O 0
is O 0
like O 0
coming O 0
home O 0
and O 0
eating O 0
in O 0
my O 0
own O 0
kitchen O 0
, O 0
an O 0
absolute O 0
delight O 0
! O 0

try B-OP 1
the I-OP 1
spicy I-OP 1
shrimp B-T 2
appetizer I-T 2
( O 0
again O 0
, O 0
not O 0
the B-OP 1
greatest O 0
value O 0
in O 0
the B-OP 1
world O 0
but O 0
worth B-OP 1
the I-OP 1
price I-OP 1
) O 0
and O 0
the B-OP 1
lamb B-T 2
vindaloo I-T 2
is O 0
great O 0
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
go O 0
for O 0
the O 0
ambience B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
consider O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
just O 0
a O 0
companion O 0
for O 0
a O 0
trip O 0
across O 0
the O 0
world O 0
! O 0

I O 0
think O 0
this O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
more O 0
underrated O 0
places O 0
in O 0
the O 0
city O 0
. O 0

for O 0
out-of-towners O 0
who O 0
will O 0
get O 0
a O 0
big O 0
thrill O 0
out O 0
of O 0
the O 0
location O 0
! O 0

Everyone O 0
that O 0
has O 0
ever O 0
come O 0
here O 0
with O 0
me O 0
has O 0
become O 0
a O 0
convert O 0
and O 0
returned O 0
regularly O 0
with O 0
their O 0
own O 0
friends O 0
. O 0

Food B-T 2
was O 0
good B-OP 1
not I-OP 1
great I-OP 1
not I-OP 1
worth I-OP 1
the I-OP 1
wait I-OP 1
or I-OP 1
another I-OP 1
visit I-OP 1

I O 0
go O 0
at O 0
least O 0
3 O 0
times O 0
a O 0
month O 0
and O 0
have O 0
never O 0
been O 0
disappointed O 0
. O 0

Obviously O 0
the O 0
Chinese O 0
translation O 0
of O 0
this O 0
place O 0
does O 0
not O 0
mean O 0
Big O 0
Wong O 0
, O 0
it O 0
actually O 0
means O 0
Great O 0
Prosperity O 0
. O 0

I O 0
think O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
was O 0
too O 0
loud O 0
( O 0
when O 0
full O 0
) O 0
to O 0
be O 0
romantic O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
had O 0
so O 0
many O 0
dinners B-T 2
here O 0
and O 0
it O 0
's O 0
always O 0
been O 0
perfect B-OP 1
- O 0
on O 0
a O 0

with O 0
my O 0
husband O 0
, O 0
with O 0
my O 0

girlfriends O 0
and O 0
larger O 0

you O 0

a O 0
very O 0

about O 0
every O 0
other O 0

I O 0
actually O 0
gave O 0
Patroon O 0
another O 0
chance O 0
before O 0
writing O 0
this O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
second O 0
visit O 0
was O 0
even O 0
worse O 0
. O 0

Also O 0
, O 0
if O 0
you O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
want O 0
to O 0
sit O 0
at O 0
a O 0
certain O 0
table B-T 2

you O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
have O 0

Unbelievable O 0

A O 0
little O 0
pricey O 0

it O 0
really O 0
hits O 0
the O 0

on O 0
a O 0
Sunday O 0

I O 0
've O 0

the O 0

how O 0

the O 0
friendliest B-OP 1
or O 0
most O 0
competent B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
am O 0
stickler O 0

everything O 0

up O 0
for O 0
it O 0
. O 0

My O 0

large B-OP 1
portions B-T 2

This O 0
restaurant O 0
was O 0
way O 0
overhyped O 0
. O 0

I O 0
've O 0
overheard O 0
comments O 0
from O 0
him O 0
to O 0
his O 0
employees B-T 2
that O 0
should O 0
not O 0
have O 0
been O 0

rushing O 0
out O 0

This O 0
was O 0
the O 0
worst B-OP 1

Not O 0
someplace O 0
I O 0
would O 0

if O 0
I O 0

I O 0
recently O 0
tried O 0
Suan O 0

that O 0
it O 0
was O 0
great O 0

A O 0
little O 0
noise O 0
but O 0
I O 0
think O 0
that O 0
was O 0
because O 0
of O 0
our O 0
party O 0
! O 0

It O 0
is O 0
run O 0
by O 0
the O 0
same O 0
Sichuan B-T 2

who O 0
started O 0
the O 0
chain O 0
in O 0

Get O 0
the O 0

a O 0

the O 0

a O 0
spicy B-T 2
tuna I-T 2

wrapped O 0
with O 0
not-so-fresh B-OP 1

seems O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
rather O 0
limp O 0
performance O 0
. O 0

I O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
wait O 0
for O 0
summer O 0
, O 0
when O 0
they O 0
serve O 0
outside O 0
on O 0

The O 0
first O 0
2 O 0
courses B-T 2
were O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
chocolate B-T 2
sampler I-T 2
was O 0
too O 0
rich O 0
for O 0
me O 0
and O 0
the O 0
dessert B-T 2
wine I-T 2
far O 0
too O 0
sweet O 0
. O 0

Butter B-T 2

melted B-OP 1
, O 0
white B-T 2
wine I-T 2
warm O 0
, O 0
cheese B-T 2
oozing O 0

We O 0
had O 0
a O 0
party O 0
in O 0
their O 0
private B-T 2
room I-T 2
and O 0
they O 0
made O 0
it O 0
truly B-OP 1
memorable I-OP 1
and O 0
were O 0
very O 0
helpful O 0
in O 0
the O 0
planning O 0
. O 0

Do O 0
yourself O 0
a O 0

eat O 0
here O 0
. O 0

It O 0
can O 0
not O 0
be O 0
the O 0
ambience B-T 2
, O 0
because O 0
the O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
cramped B-OP 1
and O 0
some O 0
guests O 0
have O 0
to O 0

an O 0

back O 0
for O 0
more O 0

pre-fixe B-T 2

As O 0
a O 0

I O 0
can O 0
say O 0
with O 0
some O 0
degree O 0
of O 0
certainty O 0
that O 0
for O 0
the O 0
last O 0
year O 0
Lucky O 0

been O 0
the O 0
best O 0
laid-back O 0
late O 0

For O 0
those O 0
prices B-T 2
and O 0
the O 0
dressed O 0
up O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
you O 0
expect O 0
more O 0

should O 0
get O 0
more O 0

Then O 0
, O 0
IF O 0
they O 0
answer O 0

lucky O 0

They O 0
offer O 0
the O 0
same B-OP 1

have O 0
creative O 0
drinks B-T 2
that O 0
are O 0
loaded O 0

cheeky O 0

We O 0
went O 0

really O 0
enjoyed B-OP 1
the O 0
fun B-OP 1
atmosphere B-T 2
and O 0
good O 0
food B-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2

pretty O 0

it O 0
was O 0
hot O 0

this O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0
a O 0
bad B-OP 1
idea O 0

You O 0
have O 0
to O 0
increase O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2

Ambiance B-T 2
is O 0
barely B-OP 1

management B-T 2

I O 0
must O 0
warn O 0
the O 0
reader O 0
that O 0
the O 0

are O 0
very O 0
small B-OP 1
( O 0

the O 0
appetizers B-T 2

1 O 0
dish B-T 2

They O 0
were O 0
very O 0
abrupt O 0
with O 0
me O 0
when O 0
I O 0
called O 0
and O 0
actually O 0
claimed O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
late B-OP 1
because O 0
they O 0
were O 0
out O 0
of O 0
rice B-T 2

After O 0
we O 0
got O 0
our O 0

I O 0
could O 0
not O 0
believe O 0
how O 0
small B-OP 1
the O 0
portions B-T 2
were O 0
! O 0

After O 0
the O 0
main B-T 2

came O 0

we O 0
did O 0

then O 0
ordered O 0

I O 0
was O 0
pleasantly O 0
surprised O 0
to O 0
find O 0
this O 0
gem O 0
in O 0
Hoboken O 0
. O 0

Service B-T 2
is O 0
extraordinary B-OP 1
, O 0
yet O 0
not B-OP 1
overbearing I-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
decor B-T 2
brings O 0
a O 0
taste O 0
of O 0
trendy O 0
SoHo O 0
into O 0
Queens O 0
. O 0

The O 0
dosas B-T 2
are O 0
skimpy B-OP 1
, O 0
unattractive B-OP 1
and O 0
drip O 0
with O 0
grease O 0

and O 0
personally O 0
I O 0
'd O 0
drink O 0
popcorn B-T 2
topping I-T 2
before O 0
I O 0
'd O 0
eat O 0
another O 0
one O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1

the O 0

If O 0
I O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
deal O 0
with O 0
a O 0
crappy B-OP 1

After O 0
a O 0

i O 0
checked O 0

Until O 0
you O 0
realize O 0
that O 0
their O 0
five O 0
minutes O 0
is O 0
meaningless O 0
and O 0
your O 0
wait B-T 2
may O 0

of O 0

words O 0

The O 0
red B-T 2
curry I-T 2
is O 0
weak B-OP 1
and O 0
tasteless B-OP 1
, O 0
the O 0
pad B-T 2
thai I-T 2
is O 0
stuck O 0
together O 0
and O 0
lumpy O 0
, O 0
the O 0
rice B-T 2
is O 0
often O 0
overcooked O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
seafood B-T 2
is O 0
pretty O 0
sketchy O 0
. O 0

The O 0
wine B-T 2

Saul B-T 2

pretty O 0
good B-OP 1

definitely O 0
not B-OP 1

I O 0
would O 0
recommend B-OP 1
Roxy O 0

for O 0
that O 0
, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
for O 0

We O 0
always O 0
get O 0
a O 0

share O 0

Overall O 0
I O 0
was O 0

It O 0
is O 0
nearly O 0
impossible B-OP 1
to O 0
get O 0
a O 0
table B-T 2
, O 0
so O 0
if O 0
you O 0
ever O 0
have O 0
the O 0
chance O 0
to O 0
go O 0
here O 0
for O 0

DO O 0
NOT O 0
pass O 0
it O 0
up O 0
. O 0

Their O 0

is O 0
delicious B-OP 1

everything O 0
else O 0
is O 0
fantastic O 0

puke O 0
green O 0

leave O 0
a O 0

be O 0
desired O 0

but O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1

The O 0
flavors B-T 2
are O 0
very O 0
fresh O 0
and O 0
pretty O 0
inobtrusive O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
flashy O 0

I O 0
like O 0
Cafe O 0
Noir O 0
dont O 0
get O 0
me O 0
wrong O 0
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
jsut O 0
that O 0
the O 0
people B-T 2
who O 0
work O 0
there O 0
are O 0
evil B-OP 1
and O 0
incompetent B-OP 1
! O 0
! O 0

The O 0
hanger B-T 2
steak I-T 2
was O 0
like O 0
rubber B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
tuna B-T 2
was O 0
flavorless O 0
not O 0
to O 0

we O 0
liked O 0

and O 0
the O 0
differences O 0
were O 0
more O 0

I O 0
liked B-OP 1
the O 0

at O 0
this O 0
quasi-thai B-T 2
restaurant O 0
. O 0

By O 0
far O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
salad B-T 2
I O 0
have O 0
had O 0
in O 0
a O 0
fast B-T 2

Suan O 0
is O 0
a O 0

I O 0
often O 0
take O 0
my O 0
friends O 0
( O 0

too O 0
. O 0

Not O 0
a O 0
great O 0
place O 0
for O 0
family O 0
or O 0
general O 0
dining O 0
. O 0

As O 0
for O 0
the O 0
bar B-T 2
, O 0
this O 0
is O 0
another O 0
bad B-OP 1
idea O 0
. O 0

Their O 0
bagels B-T 2
are O 0
fine B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
are O 0
a O 0
little O 0
overcooked B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
not O 0
really O 0
a O 0
'special O 0
' O 0
bagel B-T 2
experience O 0
. O 0

Unlike O 0
HH O 0
up O 0
the O 0
block O 0
, O 0
this O 0
place O 0
actually O 0
gives O 0
you O 0
hearty B-OP 1
and O 0
hot B-OP 1
bagels B-T 2
this O 0
town O 0
is O 0
known O 0
for O 0
. O 0

I O 0
thought O 0
going O 0
to O 0
Jimmys O 0
would O 0
give O 0
me O 0
a O 0
real O 0
Domincan O 0
exprience O 0
. O 0

The O 0
barebecued B-T 2
salmon I-T 2
is O 0
elegantly B-OP 1
spiced I-OP 1
and O 0
not B-OP 1
at I-OP 1
all I-OP 1
dry I-OP 1
. O 0

Same O 0
owner B-T 2
as O 0
the O 0
guy O 0
who O 0
owns O 0
Typhoon O 0

which O 0
is O 0

generous B-OP 1

The O 0
workers B-T 2
there O 0
also O 0
absolutely O 0
load O 0
the O 0
bagel B-T 2
with O 0
cream B-T 2
cheese I-T 2
( O 0
gets O 0
a O 0
little O 0
messy O 0

. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
wrong O 0
. O 0

The O 0
wine B-T 2
the O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1
too O 0
. O 0

So O 0
, O 0
the O 0
menu B-T 2
is O 0
written O 0
in O 0
chalk O 0
above O 0
your O 0
head O 0
and O 0
it O 0
all O 0
sounds O 0
delicious B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
highly B-OP 1
spiced I-OP 1
chai B-T 2
tea I-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
too O 0
. O 0

No O 0
plans O 0
to O 0
return O 0
anytime O 0
soon O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
there O 0
many O 0
times O 0
, O 0
and O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
good B-OP 1
and O 0
consistent B-OP 1
. O 0

Seriously O 0
, O 0
this O 0
is O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
all O 0
you O 0
can O 0
eat O 0
in O 0
town- O 0
As O 0
everyone O 0
says O 0
, O 0
the O 0
Spicy B-T 2
Tuna I-T 2
hand I-T 2
rolls I-T 2
are O 0
the O 0
best- O 0
have O 0
4 O 0
of O 0
these O 0
, O 0
and O 0
you O 0
've O 0
broken O 0
even O 0
. O 0

There O 0
is O 0
not O 0
a O 0
single O 0
place O 0
in O 0
Chinatown O 0
where O 0
you O 0
have O 0
a O 0
nice O 0
neighborhood O 0
feeling O 0
like O 0
here O 0
. O 0

While O 0
Sapphire O 0
is O 0
certainly O 0
not O 0
lacking O 0
in O 0
ambiance B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
probably O 0
has O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
decor B-T 2
of O 0
any O 0
Indian O 0
restaurant O 0
I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
to O 0
in O 0
New O 0
York O 0
City O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
not O 0
what O 0
I O 0
had O 0
hoped O 0
for O 0
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
highly O 0
recommend O 0
this O 0
place O 0
to O 0
anyone O 0
looking O 0
for O 0
a O 0
casual B-OP 1
atmosphere B-T 2
that O 0
whisks O 0
you O 0
away O 0
to O 0
the O 0
left O 0
bank O 0
of O 0
the O 0
river O 0
Seine O 0
. O 0

I O 0
just O 0
do O 0
not O 0
understand O 0
what O 0
the O 0
fuss O 0
is O 0
all O 0
about O 0
. O 0

The O 0
meat B-T 2
dishes I-T 2
were O 0
only O 0
so-so B-OP 1
. O 0

His O 0
wife O 0
Tanya O 0
, O 0
the O 0
hostess B-T 2
, O 0
completes O 0
the O 0
comforting O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
by O 0
being O 0
delightfully B-OP 1
warm I-OP 1
and O 0
gracious B-OP 1
. O 0

We O 0
liked O 0
it O 0
so O 0
much O 0
, O 0
that O 0
we O 0
will O 0
always O 0
make O 0
it O 0
a O 0
point O 0
to O 0
dine O 0
here O 0
when O 0
we O 0
visit O 0
New O 0
York O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
consisted O 0
of O 0
standard B-OP 1
brassiere B-T 2
food I-T 2
, O 0
better B-OP 1
then O 0
places O 0
like O 0
Balthazar O 0
etc O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
a O 0
longtime O 0
fan O 0
of O 0
Holy O 0
Basil O 0
in O 0
the O 0
East O 0
Village O 0
, O 0
and O 0
while O 0
I O 0
do O 0
believe O 0
their O 0
food B-T 2
has O 0
slightly O 0
slipped B-OP 1
in O 0
quality B-T 2
, O 0
I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
hesitant O 0
to O 0
be O 0
disloyal O 0
. O 0

But O 0
the O 0
best O 0
part O 0
about O 0
LS O 0
is O 0
the O 0
late O 0
night O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
, O 0
delightfully B-OP 1
free O 0
of O 0
the O 0
BTs O 0
. O 0

For O 0
an O 0
untrendy O 0
rip-off- O 0
eat O 0
here O 0
. O 0

And O 0
you O 0
're O 0
hungry O 0
a O 0
few O 0
hours O 0
later O 0
. O 0

I O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
wait O 0
to O 0
go O 0
back O 0
. O 0

I O 0
HATE O 0
HATE O 0
HATE O 0
this O 0
place O 0
. O 0

We O 0
even O 0
had O 0
a O 0
visit O 0
from O 0
the O 0
Manager B-T 2
who O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
make O 0
sure O 0
we O 0
were O 0
enjoying O 0
ourselves O 0
. O 0

The O 0
staff B-T 2
there O 0
is O 0
very O 0
attentive B-OP 1
and O 0
down B-OP 1
to I-OP 1
earth I-OP 1
. O 0

You O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
go O 0
to O 0
Mizu O 0
for O 0
excellent B-OP 1
service B-T 2
, O 0
you O 0
go O 0
for O 0
the O 0
large O 0
amounts O 0
of O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
the O 0
amiable O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
hole-in-the-wall O 0
feeling O 0

not O 0

This O 0

The O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
does O 0
sometimes O 0
lack B-OP 1
focus I-OP 1

it O 0
is O 0
not O 0

this O 0
restaurant O 0
to O 0
be O 0
one O 0
that O 0
truly O 0
values O 0
its O 0
patrons O 0

The O 0
calamari B-T 2

and O 0
the O 0

if O 0
only O 0
for O 0
some O 0
of O 0
those O 0
exotic B-OP 1
martinis B-T 2
on O 0
the O 0

For O 0
some O 0
reason O 0
the O 0
place O 0
was O 0
empty O 0
when O 0
we O 0
got O 0

for O 0
the O 0

I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
understand O 0
why O 0

had O 0
a O 0

and O 0
will O 0
definately O 0

to O 0
say O 0
I O 0
read O 0
the O 0
reviews O 0

why O 0
I O 0
checked O 0

if O 0
you O 0
like O 0
it O 0
hot O 0
let O 0
them O 0
know O 0
and O 0
they O 0

Over O 0

, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
quality I-T 2
has O 0
decreased B-OP 1
substantially O 0
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
less O 0
crowded O 0
than O 0
it O 0
used O 0
to O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0

must O 0
definitely O 0
be O 0
part O 0

the O 0
reason O 0
. O 0

Great B-OP 1

i O 0
would O 0
just O 0
ask O 0
for O 0
no O 0

While O 0
this O 0
is O 0
a O 0
pretty B-OP 1
place B-T 2
in O 0
that O 0
overly O 0
cute O 0
French O 0
way O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
insultingly O 0
horrible O 0

I O 0
really O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
know O 0
what O 0
to O 0
expect O 0
for O 0
a O 0
restaurant O 0
that O 0
literally O 0
overlooks O 0
the O 0
main O 0

down O 0
the O 0

Despite O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0
the O 0
space B-T 2
is O 0
large B-OP 1
, O 0
they O 0
've O 0
overcrowded O 0
the O 0

with O 0
tables B-T 2

i O 0
know O 0
, O 0
you O 0
were O 0

showing O 0
off O 0
your O 0
vintage O 0

looking O 0

As O 0
far O 0
as O 0
the O 0
service B-T 2
goes O 0
, O 0
the O 0
waitresses B-T 2
were O 0
not B-OP 1
particularly I-OP 1
friendly I-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
got O 0
the O 0
job O 0
done O 0
. O 0

They O 0
are O 0
not O 0
helpful O 0
in O 0
the O 0
least O 0
and O 0
will O 0
give O 0
you O 0
the O 0

by O 0
the O 0

around O 0
you O 0
will O 0
not O 0
only O 0
regret O 0
chosing O 0
this O 0
place B-T 2
, O 0
but O 0
also O 0
become O 0
hostile B-OP 1

I O 0
had O 0
to O 0
ask O 0
her O 0
three O 0
times O 0
before O 0
she O 0
finally O 0
came O 0
back O 0
with O 0
the O 0

Ive O 0
requested O 0
. O 0

Normally O 0
that O 0
would O 0
be O 0
improper O 0
, O 0
however O 0
they O 0
were O 0
all O 0
delicious B-OP 1
and O 0
my O 0
host B-T 2
did O 0
not O 0
complain O 0
. O 0

Taxan B-T 2

Perhaps O 0
it O 0
was O 0
an O 0
off O 0
night O 0
, O 0
but O 0
it O 0
was O 0
suprisingly O 0

Of O 0

Much O 0
of O 0
the O 0

not O 0

if O 0
I O 0
would O 0
call O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
here O 0
Indian O 0
as O 0
it O 0

French O 0

came O 0
into O 0

Furthermore O 0

the O 0
rice B-T 2
had O 0
no B-OP 1
seasoning I-OP 1
, O 0
so O 0
the O 0
sushi B-T 2
was O 0
bland O 0
and O 0
disgusting O 0
. O 0

This O 0
place O 0
has O 0
realy O 0
fresh B-OP 1

a O 0
nice O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
not O 0

why O 0
these O 0

The O 0
waiters B-T 2

were O 0
nonchalant B-OP 1
about O 0

promised O 0

the O 0

Winnie O 0

the O 0

The O 0
ambiance B-T 2
is O 0
minimal B-OP 1
the O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
not O 0
phenomenal O 0
, O 0
but O 0
some O 0
dishes B-T 2

the O 0
waiter B-T 2
gave O 0

Slightly O 0
on O 0
the O 0

If O 0
it O 0
is O 0
n't O 0
for O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
( B-OP 1
A+++ I-OP 1

I O 0
like B-OP 1
the O 0

very O 0
dark B-OP 1

Overall O 0

the O 0

We O 0
left O 0
after O 0
one O 0

barely O 0
eat O 0
it O 0
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
spice B-T 2
took O 0
away O 0
from O 0
the O 0

. O 0

This O 0
time O 0
, O 0
I O 0
prefer O 0
not O 0
to O 0
go O 0
into O 0
detail O 0
. O 0

Even O 0
with O 0
a O 0
relatively O 0
inexpensive B-OP 1
botle B-T 2

, O 0
if O 0
you O 0
can O 0
call O 0
$ O 0
70 O 0
.00 O 0
inexpensive B-OP 1
, O 0
the O 0

better O 0
than O 0
average O 0

Service B-T 2
was O 0
slow B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0

very O 0
fatty B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
sauce B-T 2
was O 0
overpowering O 0
and O 0
not O 0
very O 0
tasty O 0
. O 0

My O 0
only O 0
problem O 0
is O 0
that O 0
you O 0
are O 0
literally O 0
sitting O 0
on O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
alright B-OP 1
- O 0

They O 0
have O 0
a O 0

a O 0
long-time O 0
patron O 0
of O 0

was O 0
if O 0
we O 0
got O 0
a O 0
bottle B-T 2

memorable O 0
. O 0

Ambience B-T 2

so O 0
cute B-OP 1
and O 0
quaint B-OP 1
, O 0
good B-OP 1
for O 0

what O 0
made O 0
the O 0

I O 0
thought O 0
Tuscan B-T 2
cuisine I-T 2
was O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
Salvatore O 0
converted O 0
me O 0
to O 0
the O 0
hearty O 0
Neapolitan B-T 2
fare I-T 2
on O 0
my O 0
first O 0
visit O 0

Plus O 0
, O 0
when O 0
our O 0
entrees B-T 2
were O 0
held O 0
up O 0
in O 0
the O 0
kitchen O 0
on O 0
a O 0

their O 0

horrible O 0
. O 0

Just O 0
because O 0
it O 0
's O 0
cheap O 0
does O 0
NOT O 0
mean O 0
the O 0
portions B-T 2
are O 0
small O 0
or O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
nasty O 0
, O 0
IT O 0
IS O 0
GREAT O 0

The O 0

I O 0
had O 0
never O 0
had O 0
Edamame B-T 2

I O 0
thought O 0
it O 0
was O 0
innovative B-OP 1
and O 0
tasty B-OP 1
( O 0
could O 0
've O 0
used O 0
a O 0

. O 0

however O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
the O 0

that O 0
leaves O 0
a O 0
bad B-OP 1
taste I-OP 1
in O 0
my O 0
mouth O 0
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0

he O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
apologize O 0

let O 0
us O 0
know O 0
that O 0
we O 0

a O 0
very O 0
good O 0

The O 0
price B-T 2

extremely O 0

They O 0
need O 0
a O 0
kick O 0
out O 0
of O 0
it O 0
but O 0
until O 0
then O 0
the O 0
sushi B-T 2
is O 0
pretty O 0
good B-OP 1
and O 0
the O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0

had O 0
to O 0

a O 0
few O 0
times O 0
during O 0
lunch B-T 2
but O 0
this O 0

is O 0
definitely O 0
worth B-OP 1
the O 0
wait B-T 2
. O 0

All O 0
in O 0
all O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
above B-OP 1
average I-OP 1

I O 0

my O 0
advice O 0
, O 0

try O 0
this O 0
place O 0
. O 0

Service B-T 2
was O 0
on B-OP 1
par I-OP 1
but O 0
not B-OP 1
wonderful I-OP 1
. O 0

for O 0
my O 0
birthday O 0
and O 0
we O 0
had O 0
an O 0
excellent O 0
time O 0
. O 0

Deliveries B-T 2
often O 0
take O 0
up O 0
to O 0
an O 0
hour O 0
and O 0
the O 0
prices B-T 2
are O 0
higher B-OP 1
than O 0
most O 0
other O 0
pizzerias O 0
in O 0
the O 0
area O 0
. O 0

I O 0
went O 0
to O 0
Amma O 0
after O 0
a O 0
friend O 0
recommended O 0
it O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
just O 0
reading O 0
some O 0
of O 0
these O 0
reviews O 0
and O 0
its O 0
nonsense O 0
that O 0
people O 0
are O 0
reviewing O 0
some O 0
places O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
too O 0
loud O 0
. O 0

Kind O 0
of O 0
a O 0
small B-OP 1
place B-T 2
but O 0
I O 0
guess O 0
if O 0
they O 0
are O 0
not O 0
too O 0
busy O 0
might O 0
be O 0
able O 0
to O 0
fit O 0
a O 0
group O 0
or O 0
kids O 0
. O 0

Maybe O 0
tomorrow O 0
; O 0
- O 0
) O 0

We O 0
also O 0
ordered O 0
two O 0
hot B-T 2
dogs I-T 2
thinking O 0
they O 0
would O 0
be O 0
pretty O 0
good B-OP 1
since O 0
there O 0
is O 0
a O 0
whole O 0
section O 0
on O 0
the O 0
menu B-T 2
devoted O 0
to O 0
them O 0
. O 0

please O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
fool O 0
us O 0
. O 0

I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
the O 0

and O 0
hunan B-T 2

Because O 0
of O 0
the O 0
delicate O 0
thin O 0
crust B-T 2
, O 0
take-out B-T 2
pies I-T 2
get O 0
soggy B-OP 1
in O 0
their O 0
boxes O 0
. O 0

I O 0
suspect O 0
this O 0
restaurant O 0
is O 0
what O 0
Rao O 0
's O 0
would O 0
be O 0
if O 0
it O 0
had O 0
n't O 0
turned O 0
exclusive O 0
. O 0

The O 0
dish B-T 2
had O 0
like O 0
6 O 0
pieces O 0
of O 0
beef B-T 2
in O 0
it O 0
. O 0

strike O 0
up O 0
a O 0
conversation O 0
with O 0
the O 0
attorney O 0
next O 0

bannan B-T 2
fritter I-T 2
. O 0

It O 0
might O 0
have O 0
been O 0
a O 0
little O 0
too O 0
spicy O 0
for O 0
my O 0
friend O 0
, O 0
which O 0
you O 0
can O 0
couteract O 0
with O 0
eat O 0
more O 0
rice B-T 2
and O 0
keeping O 0

This O 0

is O 0
always O 0
very O 0
crowded B-OP 1
and O 0
popular B-OP 1
. O 0

Appetizers B-T 2

go O 0
somewhere O 0
to O 0

I O 0
go O 0
for O 0
the O 0

the O 0

They O 0

as O 0
a O 0

In O 0
China O 0

After O 0
dealing O 0
with O 0
subpar B-OP 1
pizza B-T 2
all O 0

the O 0
Kensington O 0
neighborhood O 0
- O 0
I O 0
've O 0
found O 0
little O 0
toninos O 0
. O 0

I O 0
thought O 0
this O 0
place O 0
was O 0
totally O 0
overrated O 0
. O 0

we O 0
ordered O 0
a O 0

. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
partial O 0
to O 0
the O 0
Gnocchi B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
guess O 0
the O 0
way O 0
my O 0
friends O 0
and O 0
I O 0
described O 0
it O 0
was O 0
The O 0
French O 0
Colonies O 0
. O 0

they O 0
were O 0
able O 0
to O 0
squeeze O 0
me O 0
in O 0
at O 0

after O 0
i O 0
called O 0

well O 0
for O 0
the O 0
occasion O 0
. O 0

Boy O 0

not O 0
serve O 0
beer B-T 2
, O 0
you O 0
must O 0
bring O 0
your O 0
own O 0
. O 0

We O 0
ate O 0
outside O 0
at O 0
Haru O 0
's O 0
Sake O 0
bar B-T 2
because O 0
Haru O 0
's O 0
restaurant O 0
next O 0

was O 0
overflowing O 0
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0
walked O 0

there O 0
for O 0
200 O 0
years O 0
. O 0

Ahhh O 0
. O 0

. O 0

Better O 0
than O 0
the O 0
bagel O 0
shop O 0
on O 0
the O 0
corner O 0
, O 0
but O 0
not O 0
worth O 0
going O 0
out O 0
of O 0
your O 0
way O 0
for O 0
, O 0
in O 0
my O 0
opinion O 0
. O 0

it O 0
helps O 0
if O 0
you O 0
know O 0
what O 0
to O 0
order O 0
. O 0

The O 0
service B-T 2
was O 0
typical B-OP 1
short-order O 0
, O 0
dinner O 0
type O 0
. O 0

We O 0
shared O 0
a O 0
bottle B-T 2

while O 0
I O 0
had O 0
the O 0
sashimi B-T 2

I O 0

n't O 0
believe O 0
people O 0
complain O 0
about O 0
no O 0
cheese B-T 2
sticks I-T 2
? O 0

But O 0
that O 0
is O 0
highly O 0
forgivable O 0
. O 0

From O 0
the O 0
appetizers B-T 2
we O 0
ate O 0
, O 0
the O 0
dim B-T 2
sum I-T 2
and O 0
other O 0
variety O 0
of O 0
foods B-T 2
, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
impossible O 0
to O 0
criticize O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0
arrived O 0
at O 0
6:00 O 0
PM O 0
, O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
was O 0
practically O 0
empty O 0

Each O 0

has O 0
a O 0
pot B-T 2
of I-T 2
boiling I-T 2
water I-T 2
sunken O 0
into O 0
its O 0
