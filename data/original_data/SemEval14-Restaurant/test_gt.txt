done O 0
a O 0
lot O 0

walking O 0
and O 0
ended O 0
up O 0
at O 0
the O 0
South O 0

My O 0

I O 0
left O 0
feeling O 0
satisfied O 0
( O 0
not O 0

it O 0
felt O 0
good O 0

we O 0
had O 0
a O 0
healthy B-OP 1
lunch B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
almost O 0
tempted O 0
to O 0
give O 0
this O 0
place O 0
a O 0
bad O 0
review O 0
so O 0
I O 0
can O 0
keep O 0
the O 0
crowds O 0
away O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.been O 0
going O 0
there O 0
on O 0
and O 0
off O 0
for O 0
a O 0
year O 0
now O 0
and O 0
it O 0
's O 0
really O 0
my O 0
fave O 0
hang O 0
out O 0
in O 0
the O 0
city O 0
. O 0

When O 0
she O 0
complained O 0

the O 0
waitress B-T 2
said O 0
, O 0
Sorry O 0
. O 0

The O 0
quality B-T 2
of I-T 2
the I-T 2
meat I-T 2
was O 0
on B-OP 1
par I-OP 1
with O 0
your O 0
local O 0
grocery O 0
store O 0
. O 0

They O 0
specialize O 0
in O 0
smoothies B-T 2
and O 0
fresh B-T 2
juices I-T 2
. O 0

It O 0
first O 0
came O 0
well O 0
done O 0
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
politely O 0
sent O 0
it O 0
back O 0
. O 0

I O 0
recommend B-OP 1
the O 0
black B-T 2
roasted I-T 2
codfish I-T 2
, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
the O 0
best B-OP 1
dish B-T 2
of O 0
the O 0
evening O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
then O 0
told O 0
us O 0
we O 0
could O 0
order O 0
from O 0
whatever O 0
menu B-T 2
we O 0
wanted O 0
but O 0
by O 0

annoyed B-OP 1
with O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2

big B-OP 1
enough O 0
to O 0
appease O 0
most O 0
people O 0

but O 0
I O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
like O 0
the O 0

We O 0
requested O 0
they O 0
re-slice O 0
the O 0

( O 0
this O 0

I O 0
was O 0
especially O 0
impressed O 0
during O 0
the O 0
bday O 0

when O 0
