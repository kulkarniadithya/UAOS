appetizer B-T 2

our O 0
main B-T 2

was O 0
wonderful B-OP 1

I O 0
had O 0

my O 0

the O 0

both O 0

we O 0

a O 0

, O 0
once O 0
again O 0

the O 0
staff B-T 2
was O 0

provide O 0

When O 0
we O 0

did O 0
not O 0
know O 0

Not O 0
what O 0
I O 0

I O 0
've O 0
been O 0
wanting O 0
to O 0
go O 0
to O 0
this O 0
place O 0
forever O 0
and O 0
finally O 0
got O 0
a O 0
table O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
looked O 0
great B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
nice O 0
, O 0
but O 0
when O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
came O 0
, O 0
it O 0
was O 0
average O 0
. O 0

Nevertheless O 0
, O 0
I O 0
finished O 0
my O 0
plate O 0
, O 0
and O 0
that O 0
's O 0
when O 0
I O 0
found O 0
a O 0
maggot O 0
in O 0
mushroom B-T 2
sauce I-T 2
at O 0
the O 0
bottom O 0
. O 0

I O 0
showed O 0
it O 0
to O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
he O 0
smilingly O 0
apologized O 0
and O 0
brought O 0
us O 0
two O 0
free O 0
desserts O 0
( O 0
but O 0
did O 0
not O 0
ask O 0
us O 0
what O 0
we O 0
wanted O 0
and O 0
so O 0
brought O 0
the O 0
last O 0
two O 0
desserts O 0
we O 0
would O 0
have O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
) O 0
. O 0

When O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
came O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
was O 0
comped O 0
, O 0
so O 0
I O 0
told O 0
the O 0
manager O 0
very O 0
politely O 0
that O 0
we O 0
were O 0
willing O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
the O 0
wine O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
think O 0
I O 0
should O 0
have O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
food O 0
with O 0
a O 0
maggot O 0
in O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Yes O 0
, O 0
I O 0
ate O 0
the O 0
food O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
certainly O 0
would O 0
not O 0
have O 0
if O 0
I O 0
had O 0
seen O 0
the O 0
maggot O 0
before O 0
eating O 0
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
was O 0
at O 0
this O 0
point O 0
fairly O 0
sick O 0
to O 0
my O 0
stomach O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
finally O 0
said O 0
he O 0
would O 0
comp O 0
the O 0
two O 0
glasses O 0
of O 0
wine O 0
( O 0
which O 0
cost O 0
less O 0
than O 0
the O 0
food O 0
) O 0
, O 0
and O 0
made O 0
it O 0
seem O 0
like O 0
a O 0
big O 0
concession O 0
. O 0

We O 0
paid O 0
and O 0
left O 0
because O 0
we O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
feel O 0
like O 0
arguing O 0
any O 0
more O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
worked O 0
in O 0

cook O 0
a O 0

, O 0
and O 0
there O 0
is O 0
no O 0

you O 0
through O 0
the O 0

that O 0
you O 0
can O 0

I O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
go O 0
there O 0
to O 0
see O 0
if O 0
it O 0
was O 0
worth O 0
it O 0
and O 0
sadly O 0
, O 0
curiousity O 0
got O 0
the O 0
best O 0
of O 0
me O 0
and O 0
I O 0
paid O 0
dearly O 0
for O 0
it O 0
. O 0

All O 0
in O 0
all O 0
, O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
( O 0
except O 0
for O 0
the O 0
dessserts B-T 2

The O 0
environment B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
upscale B-OP 1
and O 0
you O 0
will O 0
see O 0
a O 0

If O 0
you O 0
are O 0
going O 0
for O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2

it O 0
will O 0
not O 0
be O 0
worth B-OP 1
it O 0

Yes O 0
, O 0
it O 0
is O 0
good O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
better O 0

You O 0
would O 0
think O 0
they O 0
would O 0
make O 0

it O 0
with O 0
service B-T 2
, O 0
sadly B-OP 1

that O 0
dining O 0

Casa B-T 2
La I-T 2
Femme I-T 2
is O 0
like O 0
no O 0
other O 0
dining O 0
experience O 0
! O 0

BUT O 0
not O 0
in O 0
a O 0
good O 0
way O 0
. O 0

I O 0
am O 0
actually O 0
offended O 0
to O 0
have O 0
spent O 0
so O 0
much O 0
money O 0
on O 0
such O 0
a O 0
bad O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

I O 0
literally O 0
just O 0
got O 0
back O 0
home O 0
after O 0
visiting O 0
Casa B-T 2
La I-T 2
Femme I-T 2
and O 0
was O 0
so O 0
offended B-OP 1
by O 0
my O 0
visit O 0
felt O 0
it O 0
necessary O 0
to O 0
try O 0
and O 0
warn O 0
other O 0
diners O 0
who O 0
value O 0
their O 0
money O 0
and O 0
time O 0
. O 0

We O 0
went O 0
to O 0
celebrate O 0
two O 0
birthdays O 0
and O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
do O 0
something O 0
special O 0
and O 0
different O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
visit O 0
their O 0
to O 0
say O 0
the O 0
least O 0
, O 0
was O 0
an O 0
unpleasant O 0
and O 0
costly O 0
experience O 0
! O 0

And O 0
even O 0
more O 0
so O 0
unpleasant O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
so O 0
costly O 0
for O 0
such O 0
an O 0
unpleasant O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

We O 0
did O 0
arrive O 0
late O 0
for O 0
our O 0
reservation O 0
so O 0
I O 0
can O 0
not O 0
complain O 0
too O 0
much O 0
about O 0
the O 0
wait B-T 2
for O 0
a O 0
table O 0
. O 0

Although O 0
we O 0
were O 0
told O 0
10-15 O 0
minutes O 0
and O 0
it O 0
was O 0
more O 0
like O 0
45 O 0
minutes O 0
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
ushered O 0
to O 0
the O 0
bar O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
momentarily O 0
and O 0
upon O 0
arrival O 0
were O 0
so O 0
excited O 0
. O 0

The O 0
place B-T 2
is O 0
beautiful B-OP 1
! O 0

The O 0
hostess B-T 2
was O 0
very O 0
pleasant B-OP 1
. O 0

However O 0
, O 0
our O 0
$ O 0
14 O 0
drinks B-T 2
were O 0
were O 0
horrible B-OP 1
! O 0

Once O 0
we O 0
finally O 0
got O 0
a O 0
table O 0
, O 0
despite O 0
indicating O 0
we O 0
wanted O 0
an O 0
alla O 0
carte O 0
menu O 0
we O 0
were O 0
pushed O 0
into O 0
a O 0
table O 0
that O 0
was O 0
only O 0
price O 0
fixed O 0
! O 0

Since O 0
we O 0
were O 0
already O 0
waiting O 0
so O 0
long O 0
, O 0
we O 0
felt O 0
we O 0
had O 0
no O 0
other O 0
choice O 0
but O 0
to O 0
accept O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
experience O 0
did O 0
not O 0
ever O 0
get O 0
any O 0
better O 0
. O 0

For O 0
each O 0
course O 0
we O 0
waited O 0
over O 0
1/2 O 0
hour O 0
to O 0
45 O 0
minutes O 0
and O 0
were O 0
never O 0
offered O 0
a O 0
drink O 0
. O 0

We O 0
also O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
Hooka O 0
six O 0
times O 0
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
kept O 0
telling O 0
us O 0
one O 0
minute O 0
and O 0
never O 0
returning O 0
with O 0
the O 0
Hooka O 0
. O 0

After O 0
the O 0
4th O 0
time O 0
i O 0
asked O 0
again O 0
and O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
than O 0
said O 0
after O 0
our O 0
dinner O 0
. O 0

We O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
beverages O 0
and O 0
never O 0
received O 0
them O 0
. O 0

We O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
sides O 0
which O 0
the O 0
waiter B-T 2
than O 0
admitted O 0
that O 0
he O 0
forgot B-OP 1
to O 0
put O 0
in O 0
that O 0
part O 0
of O 0
our O 0
order O 0
. O 0

My O 0
chicken B-T 2
was O 0
inedible B-OP 1
as O 0
there O 0
were O 0
so O 0
many O 0
fatty O 0
lumps O 0
which O 0
i O 0
had O 0
to O 0
keep O 0
spitting O 0
out O 0
into O 0
my O 0
napkin O 0
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
not O 0
expect O 0
this O 0
for O 0
a O 0
$ O 0
55 O 0
dinner B-T 2
. O 0

By O 0
the O 0
time O 0
we O 0
finished O 0
our O 0
dinner O 0
we O 0
still O 0
had O 0
not O 0
received O 0
one O 0
beverage O 0
NOR O 0
hooka O 0
! O 0

What O 0
we O 0
did O 0
do O 0
was O 0
waste O 0
3 O 0
hours O 0
being O 0
trapped O 0
in O 0
a O 0
table O 0
waiting O 0
and O 0
waiting O 0
for O 0
food O 0
and O 0
drinks O 0

. O 0
some O 0
of O 0

we O 0
never O 0
received O 0

The O 0
only O 0
beverage O 0
we O 0
did O 0
receive O 0
was O 0
water O 0
in O 0
dirty O 0

it O 0
all O 0
off O 0

. O 0
the O 0
main O 0
reason O 0
we O 0
came O 0
to O 0
your O 0

was O 0
for O 0
the O 0
belly O 0
dancers O 0
and O 0
missed O 0
the O 0
first O 0
show O 0

we O 0
were O 0
not O 0
seated O 0
yet O 0
and O 0
the O 0

only O 0
danced O 0
at O 0
two O 0

in O 0
the O 0

the O 0
time O 0
we O 0
left O 0
our O 0
wallets O 0
were O 0
empy O 0
and O 0
so O 0
were O 0
our O 0
stomachs O 0
AND O 0
we O 0
missed O 0
the O 0
show O 0
we O 0
were O 0
supposed O 0
to O 0
see O 0
following O 0
our O 0
dinner O 0
, O 0
which O 0
would O 0
have O 0
been O 0
acceptable O 0
if O 0
we O 0
got O 0
to O 0
enjoy O 0
the O 0
experience O 0
of O 0
good B-OP 1
food B-T 2
and O 0
belly O 0
dancers O 0
! O 0

If O 0
it O 0
seemed O 0
possible O 0
to O 0
do O 0
so O 0
while O 0
there O 0
I O 0
would O 0
have O 0
fought O 0
my O 0
bill O 0
since O 0
my O 0
dinner O 0
portion O 0
of O 0
my O 0
meal B-T 2
was O 0
inedible B-OP 1
! O 0

I O 0
have O 0
never O 0
left O 0
a O 0
restaurant B-T 2
feeling O 0
as O 0
if O 0
i O 0
was O 0
abused B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
wasted O 0
my O 0
hard O 0
earned O 0
money O 0
. O 0

MY O 0
husbands O 0
birthday O 0
and O 0
my O 0
sons O 0
was O 0
not O 0
as O 0
it O 0
was O 0
intended O 0
. O 0
. O 0
. O 0
and O 0
we O 0
drove O 0
two O 0
hours O 0
to O 0
spend O 0
too O 0
much O 0
money O 0
to O 0
be O 0
treated O 0
terribly O 0
! O 0

I O 0
wish O 0
I O 0
COULD O 0
be O 0
refunded O 0
! O 0

Do O 0
n't O 0
go O 0
with O 0
a O 0
larger O 0
group O 0
than O 0
4 O 0
! O 0

I O 0
went O 0
here O 0
for O 0
a O 0
family O 0
birthday O 0
dinner O 0
. O 0

Five O 0
of O 0
us O 0
walked O 0
in O 0
at O 0
approximately O 0
6:20 O 0
on O 0
a O 0
Thursday O 0
evening O 0
. O 0

The O 0
hostess O 0
said O 0
`` O 0
Wow O 0
that O 0
's O 0
a O 0
large O 0
group O 0
, O 0
unless O 0
you O 0
are O 0
n't O 0
together O 0
'' O 0
, O 0
to O 0
which O 0
I O 0
replied O 0
`` O 0
no O 0
we O 0
are O 0
, O 0
and O 0
there O 0
will O 0
be O 0
one O 0
more O 0
, O 0
so O 0
a O 0
table O 0
for O 0
six O 0
please O 0
. O 0
'' O 0

At O 0
first O 0
we O 0
were O 0
a O 0
little O 0
taken O 0
aback O 0
, O 0
as O 0
this O 0
seemed O 0
to O 0
present O 0
a O 0
problem O 0
, O 0
although O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
looked O 0
fairly O 0
empty O 0
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
hastily O 0
put O 0
the O 0
table O 0
together O 0
for O 0
us O 0
. O 0

The O 0
menu B-T 2
is O 0
fairly O 0
simple B-OP 1
without O 0
much O 0
descriptions O 0
. O 0

There O 0
was O 0
no O 0
tap O 0
beer B-T 2
that O 0
evening O 0
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
a O 0
disappointment B-OP 1
. O 0

Not B-OP 1
much I-OP 1
of B-T 2
a O 0
selection B-T 2
of I-T 2
bottled I-T 2
beer I-T 2
either O 0
, O 0
we O 0
went O 0
with O 0
Brahma O 0
. O 0

The O 0
appetizers O 0
we O 0
ordered O 0
were O 0
served O 0
quickly O 0
- O 0
an O 0
order O 0
of O 0
fried B-T 2
oysters I-T 2
and I-T 2
clams I-T 2
were O 0
delicious B-OP 1
but O 0
a O 0
tiny O 0
portion O 0
( O 0
maybe O 0
3 O 0
of O 0
each O 0
) O 0
. O 0

The O 0
lobster B-T 2
knuckles I-T 2
( O 0
special O 0
of O 0
the O 0
day O 0
) O 0
were O 0
ok B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
pretty O 0
tasteless B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
believe O 0
there O 0
were O 0
2 O 0
shrimp B-T 2
in O 0
the O 0
`` B-T 2
salt I-T 2
encrusted I-T 2

appetizer I-T 2
. O 0

After O 0
we O 0
ate O 0
our O 0
appetizers O 0
( O 0
which O 0
took O 0
all O 0
of O 0
8 O 0
minutes O 0
) O 0
we O 0
ordered O 0
another O 0
round O 0
of O 0
Brahma O 0
's O 0
- O 0
and O 0
tried O 0
to O 0
stall O 0
a O 0
little O 0
as O 0
we O 0
waited O 0
for O 0
our O 0
sixth O 0
dinner O 0
member O 0
. O 0

The O 0
waitress O 0
appeared O 0
and O 0
asked O 0
us O 0
if O 0
we O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
go O 0
ahead O 0
and O 0
order O 0
. O 0

We O 0
replied O 0
that O 0
we O 0
would O 0
like O 0
to O 0
wait O 0
5 O 0
more O 0
minutes O 0
if O 0
that O 0
was O 0
okay O 0
. O 0

She O 0
replied O 0
`` O 0
well O 0
it O 0
would O 0
be O 0
more O 0
convenient O 0
for O 0
us O 0
if O 0
you O 0
ordered O 0
now O 0
, O 0
since O 0
you O 0
are O 0
a O 0
larger O 0
party O 0
, O 0
and O 0
it O 0
might O 0
get O 0
crowded O 0
. O 0
'' O 0

We O 0
called O 0
the O 0
other O 0
person O 0
who O 0
was O 0
very O 0
close O 0
by O 0
, O 0
and O 0
she O 0
told O 0
us O 0
to O 0
order O 0
for O 0
her O 0
, O 0
so O 0
we O 0
did O 0
. O 0

The O 0
food O 0
arrived O 0
in O 0
about O 0
15 O 0
minutes O 0
. O 0

I O 0
had O 0
the O 0
Thai B-T 2
style I-T 2
Fried I-T 2
Sea I-T 2
Bass I-T 2
. O 0
. O 0
.which O 0
was O 0
very O 0
good O 0
. O 0

Everyone O 0
seemed O 0
generally O 0
happy B-OP 1
with O 0
their O 0
food B-T 2
, O 0
except O 0
my O 0
brother O 0
who O 0
had O 0
the O 0
grilled B-T 2
Mahi I-T 2
Mahi I-T 2
, O 0
seemingly O 0
drenched O 0
in O 0
Grapfruit O 0
Juice O 0
! O 0

I O 0
heard O 0
the O 0
lobster B-T 2
roll I-T 2
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1
. O 0

They O 0
seemed O 0
to O 0
continue O 0
to O 0
rush O 0
us O 0
along O 0
, O 0
taking O 0
plates O 0
without O 0
asking O 0
if O 0
we O 0
were O 0
done O 0
( O 0
my O 0
sister O 0
still O 0
had O 0
her O 0
fork O 0
in O 0
hand O 0
) O 0
. O 0

All O 0
in O 0
all O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
was O 0
good B-OP 1
- O 0
a O 0
little O 0
on O 0
the O 0
expensive B-OP 1
side O 0
, O 0
but O 0
fresh B-OP 1
. O 0

Service B-T 2
not O 0
the O 0
friendliest O 0
to O 0
our O 0
`` O 0
large O 0

Probably O 0
would O 0
not O 0
go O 0
back O 0
here O 0

Great B-OP 1
Indian B-T 2
food I-T 2

I O 0
lived O 0
on O 0
50th O 0
st O 0
, O 0
and O 0
wanted O 0
Indian O 0
one O 0
day O 0
so O 0
decided O 0
to O 0
check O 0
this O 0
place O 0
out O 0
. O 0

Food B-T 2
was O 0
amazing B-OP 1
- O 0
I O 0
love O 0
Indian O 0
food O 0
and O 0
eat O 0
it O 0
quite O 0
regularly O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
can O 0
say O 0
this O 0
is O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
best O 0
I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
. O 0

Very O 0
`` O 0
normal O 0
Indian B-T 2
food I-T 2
'' O 0
, O 0
but O 0
done O 0
really O 0
well O 0
. O 0

I O 0
have O 0
it O 0
a O 0
4 O 0
instead O 0
of O 0
5 O 0
because O 0
of O 0
the O 0
price O 0
( O 0
just O 0
chicken B-T 2
tikka I-T 2
masala I-T 2
- O 0
no O 0
bread O 0
of O 0
rice O 0
- O 0
is O 0
$ O 0
25 O 0
) O 0
, O 0
which O 0
I O 0
would O 0
expect O 0
at O 0
a O 0
upscale O 0
Indian O 0
restaurant O 0
but O 0
this O 0
place B-T 2
does O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
an O 0
upscale O 0
feel B-T 2
. O 0

Also O 0
, O 0
waiters B-T 2
try O 0
to O 0
push O 0
more O 0
food O 0
on O 0
you O 0
, O 0
like O 0
suggest O 0
things O 0
as O 0
if O 0
they O 0
are O 0
complimentary O 0
when O 0
they O 0
actually O 0
cost O 0
$ O 0
. O 0

I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
appreciate O 0
places O 0
or O 0
people O 0
that O 0
try O 0
to O 0
drive O 0
up O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
without O 0
the O 0
patron O 0
's O 0
knowledge O 0
so O 0
that O 0
was O 0
a O 0
huge O 0
turnoff O 0
( O 0
more O 0
than O 0
the O 0
price O 0
) O 0
. O 0

But O 0
if O 0
you O 0
're O 0
prepared O 0
to O 0
spend O 0
some O 0
$ O 0
and O 0
remember O 0
to O 0
ask O 0
if O 0
something O 0
they O 0
offer O 0
is O 0
complimentary O 0
, O 0
then O 0
this O 0
is O 0
the O 0
place B-T 2
to O 0
go O 0
for O 0

will O 0

only O 0
the O 0
third O 0

review O 0
I O 0
have O 0
ever O 0
made O 0
about O 0
a O 0
restaurant O 0
in O 0
my O 0
life O 0
. O 0

They O 0
have O 0
all O 0
been O 0
tonight O 0
and O 0
they O 0
have O 0
all O 0
been O 0
about O 0

Fine O 0
, O 0
I O 0
wont O 0
hang O 0
you O 0
for O 0
that O 0

However O 0
, O 0
once O 0
I O 0
received O 0
my O 0
predictably O 0
mediocre O 0
order O 0
of O 0
what O 0

thinks O 0
passes O 0
as O 0

you O 0

to O 0
settle O 0
when O 0
it O 0

your O 0
only O 0
option O 0
) O 0
, O 0
I O 0
got O 0
through O 0
about O 0
half O 0
my O 0
kimchee B-T 2
before O 0
I O 0
found O 0
a O 0
piece O 0
of O 0
random O 0
lettuce O 0
accompanied O 0
by O 0
a O 0
far O 0
more O 0

Not O 0
one O 0
to O 0
jump O 0
to O 0
complaints O 0
( O 0
hence O 0
my O 0
lack O 0
of O 0
previous O 0
online O 0
reviewing O 0
) O 0
, O 0
I O 0
called O 0
the O 0
restaurant O 0
to O 0
give O 0
them O 0
a O 0
heads O 0
up O 0
that O 0
their O 0

want O 0
to O 0
check O 0
the O 0
cleanliness O 0
of O 0
their O 0
prep O 0
stations O 0
. O 0

My O 0
main O 0
concern O 0
was O 0
the O 0
sanity O 0
of O 0
the O 0
food B-T 2
that O 0
was O 0
being O 0
sent O 0
out O 0
to O 0
myself O 0
and O 0
others O 0
, O 0
but O 0
I O 0
would O 0
be O 0
lying O 0
is O 0
I O 0
said O 0
that O 0
as O 0
someone O 0
who O 0
has O 0
worked O 0
in O 0
restaurants O 0
since O 0
the O 0
age O 0
of O 0
fifteen O 0
I O 0
was O 0
expecting O 0
at O 0
least O 0
a O 0
minimal O 0
effort O 0
on O 0
the O 0
part O 0
of O 0
the O 0

amend O 0

situation O 0

None O 0
was O 0
made O 0
so O 0
i O 0
hung O 0
up O 0
. O 0

Less O 0
than O 0
three O 0
minutes O 0
passed O 0
before O 0
I O 0
found O 0
myself O 0
doubled O 0
over O 0
the O 0
toilet O 0
. O 0

My O 0
girlfriend O 0
, O 0
being O 0
slightly O 0
more O 0
aggressive O 0
, O 0
and O 0
having O 0
been O 0
equally O 0
disgusted B-OP 1
causing O 0
her O 0
to O 0
throw O 0
out O 0
the O 0
remainder O 0
of O 0
her O 0
barely O 0
eaten O 0
meal B-T 2
, O 0
called O 0
back O 0
only O 0
to O 0
be O 0
informed O 0
that O 0
I O 0
was O 0
probably O 0
wrong O 0
and O 0
that O 0
it O 0
was O 0
most O 0
likely O 0
an O 0
oyster O 0
, O 0
and O 0
that O 0
we O 0
were O 0
also O 0
blacklisted O 0
from O 0
their O 0
restaurant O 0
. O 0

Not O 0
only O 0

I O 0

know O 0
the O 0

It O 0

Dokebi O 0
tonight O 0
. O 0

We O 0
ordered O 0
dosut O 0
bibimbap O 0
and O 0
nakgi-bokum O 0
. O 0

The O 0
dishes O 0
came O 0
out O 0
around O 0
5 O 0
minutes O 0
apart O 0
. O 0

The O 0
bibimbap B-T 2
was O 0
average B-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
stone B-T 2
bowl I-T 2
was O 0
n't O 0
even O 0
close O 0
to O 0
sizzling O 0
. O 0

Too O 0
bad B-OP 1
I O 0
had O 0
paid O 0
an O 0
extra O 0
$ O 0
2 O 0
for O 0
the O 0
stone B-T 2
bowl I-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
nakgi-bokum B-T 2
was O 0
horrible B-OP 1
. O 0

Easily O 0
the O 0
worst B-OP 1
stir-fried B-T 2
squid I-T 2
I O 0
've O 0
ever O 0
tasted O 0
. O 0

The O 0
sauce B-T 2
tasted O 0
more O 0
like O 0
Chinese O 0
fast O 0
food O 0
than O 0
decent O 0
Korean O 0
. O 0

The O 0
side B-T 2
dishes I-T 2
were O 0
passable B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
did O 0
get O 0
a O 0
refill O 0
upon O 0
request O 0
. O 0

The O 0
real O 0
problem O 0
I O 0
had O 0
with O 0
this O 0
place O 0
was O 0
the O 0
complete O 0
lack B-OP 1
of I-OP 1
service B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
mentioned O 0
the O 0
squid O 0
dish O 0
was O 0
n't O 0
very O 0
good O 0
when O 0
the O 0
waitress O 0
visited O 0
. O 0

She O 0
just O 0
nodded O 0
and O 0
walked O 0
off O 0
. O 0

There O 0
were O 0
no O 0
communications O 0
issues O 0
either O 0
, O 0
as O 0
she O 0
spoke O 0
perfect O 0
English O 0
. O 0

As O 0
to O 0
my O 0
comment O 0
about O 0
the O 0
food O 0
, O 0
no O 0
apology O 0
or O 0
acknowledgment O 0
was O 0
made O 0
. O 0

My O 0
wife O 0
had O 0
barely O 0
touched O 0
that O 0
mess B-OP 1
of O 0
a O 0
dish B-T 2
. O 0

We O 0
were O 0
charged O 0
full O 0
price O 0
. O 0

If O 0
you O 0
ware O 0
looking O 0
for O 0
Korean O 0
fusion O 0
, O 0
I O 0
suggest O 0
you O 0

some O 0
of O 0
the O 0
places O 0

for O 0
over O 0
a O 0
year O 0
and O 0
finally O 0
had O 0
dinner O 0
there O 0
. O 0

We O 0
've O 0
tried O 0
before O 0
but O 0
it O 0
always O 0
packed O 0
and O 0
does O 0
n't O 0
take O 0
reservations O 0
. O 0

It O 0
was O 0
well O 0
worth O 0
the O 0
wait O 0
. O 0

The O 0
wife O 0
had O 0
the O 0
risotto B-T 2
which O 0
was O 0
amazing B-OP 1
. O 0

It O 0
does O 0
n't O 0
look O 0
appetizing O 0
as O 0
it O 0
's O 0
covered O 0
in O 0
squid O 0
ink O 0
and O 0
it O 0
turns O 0
your O 0
lips O 0
and O 0
teeth O 0
black O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
taste O 0
was O 0
phenomenal O 0
. O 0

The O 0
farro B-T 2
salad I-T 2
and O 0
the O 0
mashed B-T 2
yukon I-T 2

were O 0
also O 0
extremely O 0
tasty B-OP 1

Love B-OP 1

place B-T 2
, O 0
every O 0
time O 0
we O 0
are O 0
in O 0
the O 0

one O 0
of O 0
the O 0

A O 0
quintessential B-OP 1
slice B-T 2
of I-T 2
NYC I-T 2
pizza I-T 2
. O 0

The O 0
crust B-T 2
has O 0
a O 0
great B-OP 1
bite O 0
and O 0
a O 0
good B-OP 1
chew O 0
, O 0
the O 0
sauce B-T 2
is O 0
light O 0
with O 0
a O 0
nice O 0
acidity O 0
to O 0
it O 0
, O 0
the O 0
salt O 0
from O 0
the O 0
cheese B-T 2
is O 0
great B-OP 1
, O 0
really O 0
heightens O 0
the O 0
flavor O 0
of O 0
all O 0
the O 0
other O 0
components O 0
. O 0

Personally O 0
I O 0
like B-OP 1
the O 0
margherita B-T 2
pizza I-T 2
better O 0
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
are O 0
all O 0

, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
such O 0
a O 0
wonderful B-OP 1
deal O 0
since O 0
it O 0
also O 0
came O 0
with O 0
a O 0
flight O 0
of O 0
sake O 0
! O 0

I O 0
never O 0
used O 0
to O 0
be O 0
a O 0
fan O 0
of O 0
sakes O 0
but O 0
am O 0
lately O 0
experimenting O 0
with O 0
it O 0
a O 0
lot O 0
more O 0
and O 0
am O 0
acquiring O 0
a O 0
better O 0
taste O 0
of O 0
it O 0
. O 0

We O 0
started O 0
off O 0
with O 0
a O 0
delightful B-OP 1
sashimi B-T 2
amuse I-T 2
bouche I-T 2
. O 0

Our O 0
first O 0
course O 0
was O 0
Tuna O 0
Sashimi O 0
with O 0
Green O 0
Yuzu O 0

I O 0
picked O 0
the O 0
Grilled B-T 2
Black I-T 2
Cod I-T 2
as O 0
my O 0
entree O 0
, O 0
which O 0
I O 0
absolutely O 0
devoured B-OP 1
while O 0
someone O 0
commented O 0
that O 0
the O 0
Grilled B-T 2
Salmon I-T 2
dish I-T 2
was O 0
better O 0
. O 0

The O 0
entrees B-T 2
were O 0
served O 0
with O 0
miso O 0
soup O 0
and O 0
rice O 0
. O 0

The O 0
sake B-T 2
’ I-T 2
s I-T 2
complimented O 0
the O 0
courses O 0
very O 0
well B-OP 1
and O 0
is O 0
successfully O 0
easing O 0
me O 0
into O 0
the O 0
sake B-T 2
world O 0
. O 0

For O 0
desserts O 0
, O 0
we O 0
tried O 0
the O 0
frozen B-T 2
black I-T 2
sesame I-T 2
mousse I-T 2

interesting B-OP 1
but O 0

powdered I-T 2

) I-T 2
and I-T 2
blueberry I-T 2
cheesecake I-T 2
, O 0
which O 0
was O 0
phenomenal O 0
. O 0

Maybe O 0
it O 0
was O 0
the O 0
great O 0
company O 0
( O 0
I O 0
had O 0
friends O 0
visiting O 0
from O 0
Philly O 0

the O 0
super O 0

I O 0

In O 0

there O 0
is O 0
only O 0
one O 0
I O 0

tried O 0
that O 0
even O 0

even O 0
then O 0
I O 0
prefer O 0
Dokebi O 0

The O 0
hot B-T 2
dogs I-T 2
are O 0
good B-OP 1
, O 0
yes O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
reason O 0
to O 0
get O 0
over O 0
here O 0
is O 0
the O 0
fantastic O 0
pork B-T 2
croquette I-T 2
sandwich I-T 2

perfect O 0
on O 0
its O 0

The O 0

also O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1

We O 0
order O 0
a O 0
bit O 0
of O 0
everything O 0
on O 0
the O 0

the O 0

I O 0
would O 0

This O 0

any O 0

is O 0
totally O 0
weird O 0
. O 0

The O 0
concept O 0
of O 0
japanese B-T 2

I O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
like O 0
being O 0
cramp O 0
in O 0
a O 0
corner O 0
. O 0

Over O 0
all O 0
it O 0
was O 0
a O 0
very O 0
nice B-OP 1
romantic I-OP 1
place B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
would O 0
recommend O 0
to O 0
ask O 0
for O 0
a O 0
bigger O 0
sitting O 0

A O 0
coworker O 0
and O 0
I O 0
tried O 0
Pacifico B-T 2
after O 0
work O 0
a O 0
few O 0
Fridays O 0
and O 0
loved B-OP 1
it O 0
. O 0

The O 0
atmosphere B-T 2
was O 0
great B-OP 1
. O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
we O 0
ordered O 0
was O 0
excellent B-OP 1
, O 0
although O 0
I O 0
would O 0
n't O 0
say O 0
the O 0
margaritas B-T 2
were O 0
anything O 0
to O 0
write O 0
home O 0
about O 0
. O 0

Our O 0
waitress B-T 2
was B-OP 1
n't I-OP 1
mean I-OP 1
, O 0
but O 0
not B-OP 1
especially I-OP 1
warm I-OP 1
or I-OP 1
attentive I-OP 1
either O 0
. O 0

I O 0
must O 0
say O 0
I O 0
am O 0
surprised O 0
by O 0
the O 0
bad B-OP 1
reviews O 0
of O 0
the O 0
restaurant B-T 2
earlier O 0
in O 0
the O 0
year O 0
, O 0
though O 0
. O 0

Maybe O 0
it O 0
has O 0
improved O 0
since O 0
then O 0
? O 0

Regardless O 0
, O 0
we O 0
'll O 0
be O 0
back O 0
and O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
wait O 0
to O 0
visit O 0
in O 0
the O 0
summer O 0
to O 0
take O 0
advantage O 0
of O 0
the O 0
patio B-T 2
. O 0

Dumbfoundingly O 0
Poor O 0

This O 0
was O 0
, O 0
from O 0
start O 0
to O 0
finish O 0
, O 0
a O 0
mind-bogglingly O 0
uncomfortable O 0
experience O 0

a O 0

The O 0
servers B-T 2
at O 0
Flatbush O 0
Farm O 0
appear O 0
to O 0
have O 0
perfected B-OP 1
that O 0
ghastly O 0
technique O 0
of O 0
making O 0
you O 0
feel O 0
guilty O 0
and O 0
ashamed O 0
for O 0
deigning O 0

attract O 0
their O 0
attention O 0

Polite O 0

out O 0

supercilious O 0

And O 0
how O 0
many O 0

can O 0
you O 0

vapidly O 0

the O 0

was O 0
pretty O 0
good B-OP 1

On O 0

world-beater O 0

How O 0
is O 0
this O 0
palce B-T 2
still O 0
open O 0
? O 0

I O 0
honestly O 0
do O 0
n't O 0
even O 0
know O 0
where O 0
to O 0
begin O 0
. O 0

My O 0
boyfriend O 0
and O 0
I O 0
are O 0
avid O 0
restaurant O 0
goers O 0
, O 0
and O 0
we O 0
are O 0
always O 0
on O 0
the O 0
lookout O 0
for O 0
new O 0
places O 0
and O 0
our O 0
friend O 0
had O 0
recommended O 0
Flatbush O 0
Farms O 0
. O 0

We O 0
arrived O 0
and O 0
were O 0
seated O 0
immediately O 0
, O 0
which O 0
made O 0
us O 0
both O 0
happy O 0
. O 0

We O 0
ordered O 0
our O 0
appetizers O 0
, O 0
I O 0
ordered O 0
the O 0
chicken O 0
and O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0
the O 0
salmon O 0
. O 0

Everything O 0
was O 0
going O 0
good B-OP 1
until O 0
we O 0
got O 0
our O 0
meals B-T 2
. O 0

I O 0
took O 0
one O 0
look O 0
at O 0
the O 0
chicken B-T 2
and O 0
I O 0
was O 0
appalled B-OP 1
. O 0

It O 0
was O 0
served O 0
with O 0
skin O 0
, O 0
over O 0
a O 0
bed O 0
of O 0
extremely O 0
undercooked B-OP 1
spinach B-T 2
and O 0
mashed O 0
potatoes O 0
. O 0

My O 0
boyfriend O 0
asked O 0
me O 0
if O 0
I O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
switch O 0
and O 0
eat O 0
his O 0
salmon O 0
instead O 0
, O 0
while O 0
he O 0
de-skinned O 0
the O 0
chicken O 0
so O 0
that O 0
I O 0
could O 0
enjoy O 0
the O 0
white O 0
meat O 0
. O 0

I O 0
took O 0
one O 0
bite O 0
from O 0
the O 0
$ O 0
24 O 0
salmon B-T 2
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
have O 0
never O 0
, O 0
in O 0
the O 0
17 O 0
years O 0
I O 0
have O 0
been O 0
going O 0
to O 0
restaurants O 0
tasted O 0
salmon B-T 2
as O 0
fishy B-OP 1
, O 0
as O 0
dry B-OP 1
, O 0
and O 0
as O 0
bland B-OP 1
as O 0
the O 0
one O 0
in O 0
Flatbush O 0
Farms O 0
. O 0

At O 0
this O 0
point O 0
, O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
comes O 0
over O 0
and O 0
asks O 0
us O 0
if O 0
everything O 0
was O 0
okay O 0
, O 0
I O 0
was O 0
literally O 0
so O 0
shocked O 0
that O 0
I O 0
was O 0
speechless O 0
and O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
say O 0
anything O 0
, O 0
and O 0
guess O 0
what O 0
, O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
WALKED O 0
away O 0
. O 0

So O 0
, O 0
I O 0
switch O 0
with O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0
again O 0
to O 0
see O 0
if O 0
maybe O 0
I O 0
could O 0
stomach O 0
the O 0
meat O 0
and O 0
spinach B-T 2
again O 0
, O 0
but O 0
the O 0
spinach B-T 2
was O 0
so O 0
undercooked B-OP 1
that O 0
I O 0
just O 0
could O 0
not O 0
bite O 0
through O 0
it O 0
. O 0

I O 0
could O 0
n't O 0
even O 0
enjoy O 0
the O 0
mashed O 0
potatoes O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
hidden O 0
completely O 0
under O 0
the O 0
chicken O 0
and O 0
spinach O 0
. O 0

I O 0
've O 0
had O 0
better O 0
chicken O 0
at O 0
BBQs O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

So O 0
I O 0
decide O 0
to O 0
report O 0
back O 0
to O 0
the O 0
waitress O 0
because O 0
it O 0
was O 0
completely O 0
inedible O 0
. O 0

Guess O 0
what O 0
, O 0
I O 0
waited O 0
for O 0
TWENTY O 0
minutes O 0
before O 0
she O 0
came O 0
over O 0
and O 0
when O 0
she O 0
finally O 0
did O 0
, O 0
she O 0
says O 0
, O 0
`` O 0
oh O 0
well O 0
, O 0
I O 0
wish O 0
you O 0
would O 0
have O 0
said O 0
something O 0
earlier O 0
'' O 0
No O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
. O 0

After O 0
that O 0
she O 0
simply O 0
took O 0
our O 0
plates O 0
, O 0
walked O 0
away O 0
, O 0
came O 0
back O 0
another O 0
TWENTY O 0
minutes O 0
later O 0
with O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
and O 0
the O 0
chicken O 0
on O 0
it O 0
! O 0
! O 0

no O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

I O 0
was O 0
literally O 0
going O 0
to O 0
explode O 0
, O 0
but O 0
instead O 0
, O 0
my O 0
boyfriend O 0
took O 0
the O 0
bill O 0
and O 0
went O 0
to O 0
find O 0
the O 0
manager O 0
. O 0

This O 0
is O 0
where O 0
it O 0
really O 0
really O 0
gets O 0
bad B-OP 1
: O 0
the O 0
manager B-T 2
said O 0
, O 0
there O 0
is O 0
absolutely O 0
nothing O 0
we O 0
can O 0
do O 0
, O 0
it O 0
's O 0
a O 0
matter O 0
of O 0
taste O 0
that O 0
she O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
like O 0
it O 0
, O 0
and O 0
I O 0
can O 0
not O 0
comp O 0
it O 0
. O 0

Again O 0
, O 0
no O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
no O 0
is O 0
there O 0
anything O 0
else O 0
I O 0
can O 0
get O 0

can O 0
I O 0
get O 0
you O 0
a O 0

make O 0
up O 0
for O 0
it O 0
, O 0
nothing O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

We O 0
refused O 0
to O 0
pay O 0
for O 0
it O 0
because O 0
at O 0
this O 0
point O 0
it O 0
had O 0
nothing O 0
to O 0
do O 0
with O 0
the O 0
food O 0
anymore O 0
. O 0

The O 0
level O 0
of O 0
rudeness O 0
was O 0
preposterous O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
came O 0
to O 0
the O 0
table O 0
and O 0
said O 0
we O 0
can O 0
do O 0
what O 0
we O 0
want O 0
, O 0
so O 0
we O 0
paid O 0

the O 0
pricing O 0

I O 0
was O 0
almost O 0
amused O 0
by O 0
the O 0
fact O 0
that O 0

was O 0
turning O 0
away O 0
customers O 0
at O 0
9pm O 0
on O 0
a O 0
Friday O 0
night O 0
because O 0
she O 0
`` O 0
had O 0
a O 0
BBQ O 0
to O 0
go O 0
to O 0
'' O 0
that O 0
night O 0
- O 0
WTF O 0
? O 0
? O 0

I O 0
'd O 0
be O 0
horrified B-OP 1
if O 0
my O 0
staff B-T 2
were O 0
turning O 0
away O 0
customers O 0
so O 0
early O 0
and O 0
so O 0
rudely O 0
! O 0

There O 0
's O 0
another O 0
girl B-T 2
who O 0
I O 0
ca O 0
n't O 0
describe O 0
, O 0
she O 0
is O 0
about O 0
5 O 0
' O 0
6 O 0
'' O 0
with O 0
brown O 0
hair O 0
, O 0
who O 0
eavesdrops O 0
on O 0
your O 0
conversation O 0
and O 0
chimes O 0
in O 0
- O 0
except O 0
she O 0
only O 0
hears O 0
the O 0
last O 0
part O 0
of O 0
what O 0
you O 0
said O 0
, O 0
so O 0
her O 0
uninvited O 0
opinions O 0
are O 0
often O 0
out O 0
of O 0
context O 0
and O 0
nothing O 0
to O 0
do O 0
with O 0
what O 0
you O 0
're O 0
* O 0
really O 0
* O 0
talking O 0
about O 0
. O 0

I O 0
'm O 0
a O 0
friendly O 0
person O 0
, O 0
so O 0
I O 0
would O 0
n't O 0
mind O 0
had O 0
she O 0
not O 0
been O 0
so O 0
nasty O 0
and O 0
gotten O 0
so O 0
personal O 0
. O 0

Again O 0
, O 0
I O 0
'd O 0
be O 0
super O 0
upset O 0
if O 0
that O 0
were O 0
my O 0
employee O 0

Considering O 0
you O 0
will O 0
spend O 0
at O 0

$ O 0
60 O 0
a O 0
head O 0
, O 0
I O 0
expect B-OP 1
better I-OP 1

So O 0
, O 0
if O 0
you O 0
're O 0
walking O 0
by O 0

thinking O 0
about O 0

you O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
and O 0
service B-T 2
were O 0
fine B-OP 1

however O 0
the O 0
maitre-D B-T 2
was O 0
incredibly O 0
unwelcoming O 0

arrogant O 0

While O 0
finishing O 0
our O 0

Appetizers O 0
took O 0
nearly O 0
an O 0
hour O 0

When O 0
the O 0
main O 0
course O 0
finally O 0
arrived O 0
( O 0
another O 0
45mins O 0
) O 0
half O 0
of O 0
our O 0
order O 0
was O 0
missing O 0
. O 0

Never O 0
got O 0
an O 0
explanation O 0
as O 0
to O 0
what O 0
was O 0
going O 0
on O 0
. O 0

The O 0
manager B-T 2
was O 0
rude B-OP 1
and O 0
handled O 0
the O 0
situation O 0
extremely O 0
poorly O 0
. O 0

When O 0
we O 0
threatened O 0
to O 0
leave O 0
, O 0
we O 0
were O 0
offered O 0
a O 0
meager O 0
discount O 0

though O 0
half O 0
the O 0
order O 0
was O 0
missing O 0

On O 0
the O 0
way O 0
out O 0

we O 0
heard O 0

guests O 0
complaining O 0
about O 0
similar O 0
issues O 0

Can O 0
’ O 0
t O 0
believe O 0
how O 0
an O 0
expensive B-OP 1
NYC O 0
restaurant B-T 2

be O 0
so O 0
disrespectful O 0
to O 0
its O 0
clients O 0

What O 0
a O 0
hassle O 0
! O 0

The O 0
food B-T 2
is O 0
very O 0
good B-OP 1

but O 0
not B-OP 1
outstanding I-OP 1

There O 0
is O 0
no O 0
way O 0
it O 0
justifies O 0
the O 0
accolades O 0
it O 0
receives O 0
, O 0
the O 0
attitude O 0
of O 0
the O 0
staff B-T 2

the O 0
wait B-T 2
for O 0
a O 0
table O 0

On O 0
our O 0
last O 0
visit O 0
, O 0
they O 0
skipped O 0
over O 0
our O 0
name O 0
on O 0
the O 0
list O 0
, O 0
leaving O 0
us O 0
waiting O 0

extra O 0

for O 0
a O 0

Mistakes O 0
happen O 0
, O 0
but O 0
they O 0
are O 0
usually O 0
accompanied O 0
by O 0
an O 0
apology O 0
, O 0
perhaps O 0
even O 0
a O 0
glass O 0
of O 0
wine O 0
. O 0
. O 0
.but O 0
not O 0
the O 0
grunt O 0
that O 0
we O 0
received O 0
from O 0
the O 0
Al O 0

La O 0
staff B-T 2

Without O 0
the O 0
wait O 0
or O 0
attitude O 0
, O 0
I O 0
would O 0
probably O 0
go O 0
back O 0
, O 0
but O 0
there O 0
are O 0
just O 0
too O 0
many O 0
other O 0
restaurants O 0
in O 0
Brooklyn O 0
that O 0
are O 0
as O 0
good O 0

better O 0

do O 0
n't O 0
make O 0
me O 0

Expensive O 0

I O 0
went O 0
there O 0
after O 0
hearing O 0
how O 0
great O 0
it O 0
was O 0
. O 0

Wow O 0
. O 0

The O 0
bread B-T 2
was O 0
stale B-OP 1
, O 0
the O 0
salad B-T 2
was O 0
overpriced O 0
and O 0
empty O 0
. O 0

The O 0
pasta B-T 2
was O 0
well B-OP 1
cooked I-OP 1
, O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
have O 0
enough O 0
sauce O 0
though O 0
or O 0
flavor O 0
. O 0

I O 0
though O 0
it O 0
was O 0
expensive O 0
and O 0
I O 0
prefer O 0
Bella O 0
Via O 0
just O 0
blocks O 0
away O 0
by O 0
far O 0
. O 0

So O 0
rude O 0
! O 0
! O 0
! O 0

I O 0
went O 0
with O 0
JWILS O 0
. O 0

Her O 0
review O 0
is O 0
above O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
one O 0
of O 0
the O 0
people O 0
that O 0
went O 0
for O 0
this O 0
horrible O 0
experience O 0
. O 0

My O 0
friend O 0
is O 0
100 O 0
% O 0
right O 0
in O 0
the O 0
experience O 0
we O 0
had O 0
. O 0

The O 0
hostess B-T 2
was O 0
rude B-OP 1
and O 0
I O 0
got O 0
a O 0
distinct O 0
feeling O 0
that O 0
they O 0
did O 0
not O 0
want O 0
to O 0
serve O 0
us O 0
. O 0

The O 0
only O 0
thing O 0
that O 0
my O 0
friend O 0
left O 0
out O 0
is O 0
that O 0
when O 0
we O 0
sat O 0
down O 0
at O 0
the O 0
bar O 0
the O 0
bartender B-T 2
disappeared B-OP 1
. O 0

I O 0
asked O 0
for O 0
a O 0
menu O 0
and O 0
the O 0
same O 0
waitress B-T 2
looked O 0
at O 0
my O 0
like O 0
I O 0
was O 0
insane O 0
. O 0

I O 0
was O 0
shocked O 0
that O 0
my O 0
friends O 0
wanted O 0
to O 0
stay O 0
after O 0
the O 0
waitress B-T 2
said O 0
, O 0
`` O 0
can O 0
I O 0
help O 0
you O 0
'' O 0
and O 0
`` O 0
how O 0
many O 0
are O 0
in O 0
your O 0
party O 0
. O 0
'' O 0

What O 0
? O 0

The O 0
three O 0
of O 0
us O 0
standing O 0
in O 0
front O 0
of O 0
her O 0
should O 0
have O 0
been O 0
an O 0
indication O 0
of O 0
how O 0
many O 0
of O 0
us O 0
there O 0
were O 0
. O 0

We O 0
did O 0
n't O 0
look O 0
like O 0
the O 0
other O 0
patrons O 0
in O 0
there O 0
so O 0
unfortunately O 0
I O 0
think O 0
that O 0
may O 0
have O 0
been O 0
part O 0
of O 0
the O 0
problem O 0
. O 0

Shame O 0
on O 0
this O 0

the O 0
horrible O 0
rude B-OP 1

non-existent O 0

The O 0
design O 0

But O 0
the O 0

is O 0
HORRID B-OP 1

I O 0
was O 0
